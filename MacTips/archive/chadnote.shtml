I'm wondering if you  could</P>  <P>&gt;provide some info that ShrinkWrap users might appreciate besides  what is in</P>  <P>&gt;the Read Me. I'm wondering what plans you might have for the future  and if</P>  <P>&gt;there are any thoughts you have about little known cool stuff about</P>  <P>&gt;ShrinkWrap.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Sure! Let me first start out with some news. I'm proud to announce that</P>  <P>Aladdin Systems, Inc., developer of the worldwide Macintosh compression  and</P>  <P>installation standards, StuffIt and StuffIt InstallerMaker, has just</P>  <P>recently acquired ShrinkWrap. Aladdin will continue to work closely  with</P>  <P>me and together we will release new versions of ShrinkWrap in early  1997. A</P>  <P>press release will follow later this week with more details.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Version 2.1 was just released to mark the occasion. You can download  it</P>  <P>right now from the ShrinkWrap Web site at:</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&lt;http://www.halcyon.com/shrinkwrap/&gt;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>or via FTP at the following URL:</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&lt;ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/users/chad/release/SW-2.1.hqx&gt;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>This version rolls in a bunch of bug fixes and performance tweaks that  I've</P>  <P>been working on over the summer. It will be the last major update prior  to</P>  <P>release as an Aladdin product.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>As for little known cool stuff about ShrinkWrap, I think that very few</P>  <P>people are aware that ShrinkWrap will work with any size volumes, not  just</P>  <P>floppies. So you can create and mount a disk image just as you would</P>  <P>create a RAM disk or a partition on your hard drive, but you can do  it</P>  <P>dynamically. There's no need to restart for the change to take effect  and</P>  <P>when you're done, just drag it to the trash and your Mac is restored  to its</P>  <P>original state.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>So for example, if you have a collection of Syquest cartidges that you  want</P>  <P>to archive on a Jaz drive. You can just drag the Syquest cartidges onto</P>  <P>ShrinkWrap and store their images on the Jaz cartridge as self-mounting</P>  <P>image files. Later, when you want to access the orignal contents of  the</P>  <P>Syquests, just double-click on the image file and volume will be mounted  on</P>  <P>the desktop as a partition just like it originally existed on the Syquest.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Another cool fact is that you can create space and improve the performance</P>  <P>of your hard drive by using ShrinkWrap disk images as archives,</P>  <P>particularly if you have a large hard drive. For example, if you have  a</P>  <P>collection of 1000 icons that you're storing on a 4GB hard drive, these</P>  <P>files will consume 128MB. The same files stored in a ShrinkWrap disk  image</P>  <P>will take only 2.5MB. This is because the max number of blocks an HFS</P>  <P>drive is 32768, which means that each block for a 4GB drive must be  128K.</P>  <P>If the file your storing is only 2.5K (which is the case for a custom  icon)</P>  <P>then it still takes a 128K to store, wasting 98% of the space.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>However, if you put these files into a folder and drag them onto</P>  <P>ShrinkWrap, it will create a disk image file to fit the contents of  the</P>  <P>folder, mount it on the desktop, then copy the files from the folder  to the</P>  <P>new volume. However, because the new volume will only be 2.5MB large,  its</P>  <P>allocation block size is only .5K, which means that the 1000 2.5K files  fit</P>  <P>in exactly 2.5MB and there is no wasted space. Additionally, because  the</P>  <P>1000 custom icons aren't added to the desktop database of your hard  drive,</P>  <P>the Finder's performance will improve noticeably.</P>  <P>&gt;Needless to say I think shrinkwrap is great and can't imagine life  without it!</P>  <P>Thanks!</P>  <P>Chad</P>  <P>------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>  <P>Chad Magendanz</P>  <P>Author of ShrinkWrap and ImageMaster AOL/MSN: Magendanz</P>  <P>http://www.halcyon.com/shrinkwrap/<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Bottom navbar.lbi" --><HR SIZE="4" align="CENTER"><p align="CENTER"><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><a href="../index.html" target="">MacTips</a> || <a href="../contact.shtml" target="">Feedback</a>   || <a href="../archive.shtml" target="">MacTips Archive</a> || <a href="http://www.themacintoshguy.com">The   Macintosh Guy</a> <!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p><hr size="4" align="CENTER"><div align="LEFT">    <i><font size="-1">This site, its source code, and the MacTips logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice..
