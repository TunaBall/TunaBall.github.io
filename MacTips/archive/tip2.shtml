That is wonderful         if you want to share files between your two Macs. But, if you only have         one Mac and don't plan to do any file sharing, believe it or not, you         are wasting you Mac's resources and energy on being ready to share when         it should really be set to what I call &quot;selfish&quot;.</P>      <P>Following the steps below will help you set your Mac to selfish, First         of all I make a few assumptions of which you'll want to be aware. These         instructions are only for you if...</P>      <P>1. You are running System 7.5 or later.</P>      <P>2. You are not connected to a network of any kind.</P>      <P ALIGN="CENTER">(Please be aware that any time you are making changes         to your system software one wrong click can be the cause of much grief.         As the warning in your Extensions Manager says &quot;Warning: Incorrect         use... ...may cause problems with your Macintosh&quot;)</P>      <P><FONT SIZE="+2">Step One. </FONT>Find out what kind of networking you         are using.</P>      <P>With the advent of the PCI Macs, Apple introduced Open Transport. You         are either running Open Transport or Classic Networking. The easy way         to tell which you are using is to look at your Control Panels folder.         (If you look under your Apple Menu you should see it in that menu) If         you see an item called &quot;AppleTalk&quot; you are using Open Transport.         If you see an item called &quot;Network&quot; you are using Classic Networking.</P>      <P><FONT SIZE="+2">Step Two. </FONT>Open up your extension manager.</P>      <P>Every Macintosh running System 7.5 comes with an Extensions Manager.         If you look under your Apple Menu again, and go to your Control Panels,         you should find Extensions Manager. If you open your Extensions Manager         you will find everything that loads into your System on startup. You may         recognize some of the things in that list as those which run across the         bottom of your screen at startup.</P>      <P>If you don't find an item in your Control Panels called Extensions Manager,         you may be using Conflict Catcher, or perhaps Now Startup Manager, or         another third party extension manager, if you are familiar with how yours         works open it up, the instructions will be the same regardless of which         you use.</P>      <P><FONT SIZE="+2">Step Three. </FONT>Disable the unnecessary items from         your extensions manager.</P>      <P>All the things you see in your Extensions Manager load into your Mac         when you turn it on whether you use them or not. They all use memory and         most will use processing power.</P>      <P>Depending on what form of networking you are using, follow the appropriate         directions. NOTE: None of these instructions should affect use of your         printer or your modem.</P>      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Open Transport...</FONT></B> In your Extensions Manager         disable (click on the check to make it go away) the following items; AppleShare,         File Sharing Extension, and the Network Extension.</P>      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Classic Networking...</FONT></B> In your Extensions         Manager disable (click on the check to make it go away) the following         items; AppleShare, File Sharing Extension, Network Extension, File Sharing         Monitor, Network, Sharing Setup, and Users &amp; Groups.</P>      <P><FONT SIZE="+2">Step Four. </FONT>Close your Extensions Manager and Restart         your Macintosh.</P>      <P><FONT SIZE="+2">Your Macintosh is now set to selfish! </FONT>After you         restart you may notice that your machine starts up in less time and that         you have more memory available to run your applications. If for some reason         you change your mind, just enable the things you disabled and restart         and you should be back to where you started.</P>      <P ALIGN="CENTER">If you set your Mac to selfish, I'd love to hear about         it and if you feel it helped you in any way.
