This MacTip willcover some thoughts on helping your web browser to be more stable and performbetter. Although I hope the things on this page will enhance your web experienceI know that these words will not help everyone. Please take them for whatthey are worth, for some the one thing you needed to keep your Mac fromcrashing may be found here, for others this may be a small step towardsa more stable environment.</P><P>There are a number of factors that can affect the stability of your webexperience. Some of these factors we have control over, others have to doexternal factors out of our control, like problems with your internet serviceprovider or problems with specific web sites.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Where to start.</B> Many times when we have any trouble when connectedto the internet we're often quick to blame <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A>,<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A>, <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</A>or our ISP (Internet Service Provider). Although some times this blame maybe justified most times there are things that we can do that might solveour problems. The old adage of when your pointing one finger at someoneelse there's three pointing back at you holds true here too.</P><P>The <B>first things</B> to look into when your having any sort of troubleare the things you would look into if you were having any other problem.Things like extension conflicts, corruption on your hard drive, or incompatiblesoftware versions have caused more of the problems I've seen than any specificinternet related issues. So try running with <B>minimal extensions</B>,run Disk First Aid to check the <B>integrity of your hard drive</B>, andmake sure that you are using the <B>current versions</B> of all the softwareyou are using.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/extmanicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Extension Conflicts</B> can be responsible for anynumber of complications. Many times eliminating un-necessary extensionscan be a good step towards better web stability.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/dfaicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Hard Drive Corruption</B> can also be the cause ofmany problems including problems with web stability. In general everythingyou see on a web page has been copied from someone ease's computer to yours.Every picture and the text of every web page is usually stored on you harddrive if only for a short period of time. If for some reason Corruptionon your hard drive causes problems reading or writing one of those filesa crash may be inevitable. Running <A HREF="http://swupdates.info.apple.com/cgi-bin/lister.pl?Apple.Support.Area/Apple.Software.Updates/US/Macintosh/Utilities">DiskFirst Aid</A> (a little application that came with your Mac) can be a handyway to verify the integrity of your hard drive. If you keep having to fixthe same problems time and time again that may be a sign of deeper issuesgoing on.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/greyoticon.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"><B>Outdated software</B> can sometimes be just the thingto give the needed stability to your web browsing environment. Althoughoutdated software is rarely the cause of major problems, newer softwareversions can at times eliminate those rare and hard to track down problems.This holds true for system software, network software, plug-ins , or evensystem extensions.</P><P>As far as System software, it usually make sense to run the latest versionof what you currently have. Check out 'About This Macintosh/Computer...'under the Apple Menu to see what version you are running. If you are running7.5, it might make sense to upgrade to <A HREF="http://swupdates.info.apple.com/cgi-bin/lister.pl?Apple.Software.Updates/US/Macintosh/System/System_7.5.5_Update">7.5.5</A>.If you are running 7.6, <A HREF="http://www.info.apple.com/ftp/7.6.1.html">7.6.1</A>might be a good idea. Generally those smaller updates are designed to provideeither small bug fixes, or added performance (especially with PowerMacs)and are usually downloadable for free. If your Mac is running <A HREF="http://swupdates.info.apple.com/cgi-bin/lister.pl?Apple.Software.Updates/US/Macintosh/Networking-Communications/Open_Transport/">OpenTransport</A> (Apple's networking software, if you have an 'AppleTalk' controlpanel you are using Open Transport) you should be running at least version1.1.1 (1.1.2 is the current version). Really any outdated software includingbrowser plug-ins and system extensions can be the cause of strange or erraticbehavior, checking with the company that makes your software can sometimesbe of benefit to track down some of those miscellaneous problems that cancause problems here and there.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/cybdogicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="../../images/pppicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="../../images/expicn.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"><IMG SRC="../../images/navicn.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"><B>Which web browser?</B>People often ask, &quot;Which web browser is the best?&quot; This is a difficultand an easy question. Although I'm hesitant to recommend a specific onein this forum for fear or the repercussions in e-mail. (You should hearthe flack I've gotten for simply having a best viewed with Netscape iconon my page.) Personally I'm not a fan of the single browser for all needsapproach. You know the ones that include mail, news, the net telephone,and take tons of RAM to run. Although it seems that Netscape has a reputationfor crashing more than some of the other browsers available, I'm not convincedthat any particular browser is inherently more stable than any other.</P><P>One issue that is related to which browser you choose, is the amountof ram it takes to run. If you have tons of RAM to spare, this is not aslarge an issue as it is for those who are limited in the size of the applicationsthey can run. I must admit I have been impressed with the new '<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">Internet Explorer 3.01</A>' which was totallyrewritten from the ground up for the Mac in that it can function well inabout 5 megs of ram not the 8 that <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/download/nav_download.html?navigator3.01">Navigator3 </A>requires or the more than 10 megabytes of ram that the new <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/flash1/comprod/products/communicator/index.html">NetscapeCommunicator 4</A> requires if virtual memory is off. The other thing thatimpressed me about the new Explorer is that is will even run reasonablywell on my older 68k machines. Personally I usually end up using the newestthing for a while till the next one comes out and I use that for a while.Whether you use Navigator, Explorer, Mosaic, or even CyberDog, if you suspectthat your browser might be causing you trouble try a different one and seeif it make a difference for you.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/pppicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="../../images/frepppicn.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"><B>PPP Software.</B> If you use a modemto get onto the internet you use some sort of PPP software. PPP stands forPoint-to-Point Protocol. This software handles the connection between yourcomputer and your ISP (Internet Service Provider). There are a few choicesof PPP software. <A HREF="http://www.rockstar.com/ppp.shtml">FreePPP</A>,<A HREF="http://swupdates.info.apple.com/cgi-bin/lister.pl?Apple.Software.Updates/US/Macintosh/Networking-Communications/Open_Transport">OT/PPP</A>,or MacPPP are the most common. Really if the one you are using works foryou there is no reason to consider changing it. However if you seem to havetrouble every time you try to connect to the internet or every time youdisconnect, you might want to either update the one you are using or trya different one.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Some things to try.</B> OK, let's get down to it. There are quitea few things you can try if your browser keeps crashing.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/prefs.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32">One of the more common problems is where one or more of the <B>preferencesfile will get corrupted</B>. Preference files are where the settings youchoose are stored, things like the phone number of your ISP, the settingsfor what your home page are in your browser, even your user name and passwordare often kept in preference files. The symptoms of this kind of problemcan be anything from random crashing, to you machine trying to dial theinternet when it shouldn't, to not being able to open a certain application.All preference files are stored in the 'Preferences' folder in the 'SystemFolder' of your hard drive. First try trashing the preference file for thearea in which you seem to be having trouble. If you are always crashingin your web browser, look for the folder in your preferences folder thatcontains the files for your web browser. Look for a preference or settingsfile and simply throw it in the trash. Next time you launch your web browserthat file will be recreated, and any problems that might have been, arein the trash. Other preference files that can get corrupted are PPP preferences,network preferences, internet preferences, TCP/IP preferences, etc.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/tcpdnr.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="32">Another file that can get corrupted is the 'MacTCP DNR'located in the the system folder. This file is created to provide compatibilitywith old system 6 internet applications. It too can get corrupted, throwit in the trash and it will get rebuilt next time you restart.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/navcach.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="32"><IMG SRC="../../images/expcach.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="32"><IMG SRC="../../images/navcach.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="32"><IMG SRC="../../images/expcach.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="32"><B>Cache files</B>seem to be related to much of the difficulty we may have with web browsers.Every picture you see and the text of every web page is copied over theinternet to your Mac as you view it. With the standard web browser setupthese files are stored in the preferences folder on your hard drive. Theidea of this cache file is that once an image or text of a page is loadedonto your hard drive, it won't need to be loaded over the internet the nexttime you see it. The only problem with this is that the whole process ofcopying these files over the internet to your hard drive and from your hardto your browser can be problematic.</P><P>There are two suggested solutions for getting your hard drive out ofthe mix for your cache files. One solution is to effectively disable thecache file by setting your cache file size to zero. The major drawback ofthis approach is that every time an item needs to be redrawn on the screenit must be loaded over the internet again. This will not only make returningto previously viewed pages slower, but using things like the back buttoncan be painfully slow.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/ramdiskicon.gif" WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="LEFT">The other solution for keeping your cache file off yourhard drive is the use of a <B>RAM Disk</B>. (See Tip #6 on <A HREF="tip6.shtml">TheRAM Disk.</A>) There are advantages of using a RAM disk for your cache filebeyond the possible added stability. The one major advantage of the ramdisk is fast access to your cache. Reading from a RAM disk can be many,many times faster that reading from the hard drive. In addition to speedingthe loading of previously visited pages you may notice that resizing windowsand using the back and forward buttons function wonderfully faster. Althoughusing the standard RAM Disk from the 'Memory' control panel can providethese benefits, everything on it will be erased when your computer is shutdown.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/rambsf.gif" WIDTH="178" ALIGN="RIGHT" HEIGHT="138" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"><IMG SRC="../../images/rambunc.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32">One way to receive all the benefitsof a RAM disk without loosing information between shutdowns is to use aram disk utility like <A HREF="http://www.kagi.com/authors/rambunctious/">Rambunctious</A>by Elden Wood and Bob Clark. <A HREF="http://www.kagi.com/authors/rambunctious/">Rambunctious</A>is a separate application that will build a ram disk for you on the flyand doesn't require a restart to create it like the one in the 'Memory'control panel. <A HREF="http://www.kagi.com/authors/rambunctious/">Rambunctious</A>also allows you to save all the information contained in the ram disk whenyou quit. Another nice feature of <A HREF="http://www.kagi.com/authors/rambunctious/">Rambunctious</A>is that it has the ability to automatically launch an application when theram disk is opened through a 'Startup Items' folder located on the ram disk.Placing an alias of your web browser in this folder will automatically launchit when the ram disk is loaded. The size of your ram disk will be determinedby he amount of ram you have to spare. A ram disk of even a couple megscan be sufficient to provide the added speend and stability.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/cache.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="147">Once you have built your ram disk you need to changethe location of your cache file to the ram disk. This is accomplished throughthe preferences of your web browser. Simply look at the 'Cache' sectionin the 'Advanced' area of the preferences. You should see a button thatwill allow you to choose the location of your new cache file on the ramdisk. (It is a good idea to empty the old cache folder before you selecta new one.) Just click the 'Choose...' or 'Select...' button, navigate tothe ram disk, and select it as the location for your cache file. Once youhave moved your cache file onto the ram disk you can experience enhancedperformance and possibly better web stability.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>The single thing that seems to make a biggest difference in web stabilityfor many people is to <B>simply be gentle</B>. The key to being gentle isto not try to have your web browser do too much at once. Only have one ortwo windows open at once and only downloading one or two files at the sametime can help keep your browser up and running. Another way to be gentlewith your browser is to either let each page finish loading or stop theloading with the stop button before continuing on to the next one.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Another way to increase web stability is to allocate <B>more memory</B>to your browser. Tip #14 <A HREF="tip14.shtml">Get Info and ApplicationMemory</A> has an explanation on how to use 'Get Info...' to allocate morememory to an application such as your web browser. <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A>recommends doubling the preferred size of your application or even raisingit up to 20,000 k. Although this seems a little excessive, any browser willbenefit from having more memory allocated to it.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/netplug.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"><IMG SRC="../../images/qtplug.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"><B>Mind those plug-ins!</B> Anotherways to increase web stability in your browser is to only use the plug-insthat you absolutely need. Plug-ins add functionality to your web browserby giving you the ability to see and hear additional file formats that aren'tsupported natively by your browser. <A HREF="http://www.real.com/">RealAudio</A>,<A HREF="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/">ShockWave</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.quicktime.apple.com/">QuickTime</A> are examples of some popularplug-ins. It is really easy to add a plug-in every time you see a new oneoffered but having too many can lead to conflicts. Keeping only the essentialscan be another good step towards web stability.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/ipopts.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="317" HEIGHT="171">If you're using <A HREF="ftp://ftp.info.apple.com/Apple.Support.Area/Apple.Software.Updates/US/Macintosh/Networking-Communications/Open_Transport/">OpenTransport</A>, (if you have an AppleTalk control panel you are) having <B>TCP/IPonly 'Load Only When Needed'</B> may help your computer use the networkingsoftware more efficiently, which could theoretically avoid a crash.</P><P>If you open the 'TCP/IP' control panel and select &quot;User Mode&quot;from the Edit menu you will see a number of options. Choose 'Advanced' andclick 'OK'. Then click the options button and select 'Load Only When Needed'if it isn't already selected. If you are having trouble it can't hurt totry this one either way.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Any link in the chain.</B> When trouble shooting problems with internetthings remember that you are at one end of a long chain. A problem withany link in that chain can mean trouble for you being at the end. This MacTipcovers most of my suggestions for dealing with what we can do at our end.Remember that any bad link in this chain (Modem, Phone cable, Phone line,ISP's phone connection, ISP's modem, ISP's internet connection, remote server'sconnection, etc.) could be the source of any particular problem. It isn'tunreasonable to ask for assistance from your ISP about any particular problemsto see if they have any suggestions or thoughts about your particular issue.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>I hope some of the thoughts contained in this MacTip will help enhance  and stabilize your web experience. If I have helped you understand your  Mac any better or if I helped provide you with any additional web stability,  I'd love to hear about it!
