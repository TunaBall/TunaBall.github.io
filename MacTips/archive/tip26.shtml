Each one of these thingsalone may or may not produce noticeable performance improvement but as awhole the improvement can be not only noticeable, but significant.</P><P>Whether you have a new speedy PowerMac or a more vintage Mac the fastestpart of your Mac is the processor. Everything your Mac does eats up thoseprocessor cycles. Any every other part of your computer (i.e. hard drive,ram, L2 cache, logic board) is hanging on for the ride slowing it down.When we talk about performance really there are two core issues. The firstinvolves considering processor cycles a limited commodity and spending themonly where necessary. They second factor involves allowing the faster partsof your computer (processor, caches, and ram) to not be bogged down by theslower parts (hard drive, network, etc.) The more Mhz you have the moreprocessor cycles you have at your disposal. This MacTip is designed to helpyou make the best use of what you have.</P><P>In this MacTip I 'm not going to tell you exactly what to do. My goalis to help you to understand that everything your Mac does eats up thoseprocessor cycles and to help you spend them wisely. This is important becausethe fact is that most people upgrade their computers when they can no longerstand how slow the only one has gotten. If you can remain happier with yourcurrent Mac longer, even a few months, you will be able to get more Macfor your money when you do upgrade. Many times the difference of just afew months can make hundreds of dollars of difference in purchase price.</P><P>In this MacTip we'll discuss three issues that can effect real life performance.First of all there are a number of things that can be done in terms of systemconfiguration that can make your Mac sing or crawl. Secondly there are anumber of things that can be done to make your Mac feel faster but don'treally affect anything but your perception of performance. Thirdly thereare a few things that some of us do that can reduce performance.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H2>Pour on the Power!</H2><P><IMG SRC="../../images/memctlicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Disk Cache- </B>The setting of your Disk Cache canhave a significant influence on how fast your machine functions. See <A HREF="tip3.shtml">MacTip #3</A> for a discussion on the functioning of thedisk cache. 32k for every megabyte of RAM you have is a good rule of thumbfor the disk cache setting. The only case where a smaller disk cache settingis recommended, is when your machine is primarily used for Photoshop. SupposedlyPhotoshop will perform optimally with a setting of 96k. If you don't usePhotoshop most of the time the above formula will do you well. With currentsystem software almost always a larger disk cache is better.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/exmanicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Extensions and Control Panels- </B>Which extensionsyou have loaded can make a significant difference in the performance ofyour Mac. Every extension or control panel that loads on your Mac eats upmemory and processing power. The important thing is to disable the itemsthat provide functionality that you don't use. This can free up both processingpower and memory. This is probably the most common service that I performfor my clients. Simply disabling this excess baggage can net noticeablegains in performance. <A HREF="tip2.shtml">MacTip #2, &quot;Should yourMacintosh be set to selfish?&quot;</A> discusses disabling the file sharingextensions and control panels for this very purpose.</P><P>I know it can be confusing to look at that long list of cryptic namesand figure out which items do what. I want to give you the freedom to experimentin this area. There is nothing that disabling an extension or control panelcan break that turning it back on won't fix. If you want to take the time,you can go through one by one and disable an item, restart, and see howit works. If after some time of use you don't notice anything missing, itis probably safe to say you can life without it. As long as you take yourtime to make sure you won't miss the functionality it provides, you shouldbe fine to continue to the next one.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/memctlicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Memory and Virtual Memory- </B>Memory plays a bigpart in determining how well your Mac performs. Although you can almostnever have enough memory, how you use what you have is key to getting themost out of your Mac. <A HREF="tip4.shtml">MacTip #4</A> talks about VirtualMemory. In short, if there is any way you can run with virtual memory off,you should. In some real life tests I've found that having VM off can improveperformance 50%-200%. If you don't haven enough ram to run with VM off keepit to the lowest setting possible.</P><P><B>Application Memory Allocation- </B>A factor that can effect the performanceof individual applications is the amount of memory allocated to each one.Many times a difference of only a few hundred kilobytes of ram can makedramatic differences in how speedy your applications will function for you.Case in point I have used a little utility to merge the addresses for theannouncement list. the first time I used it to merge my address list ittook over 8 hours to work through the list. Simply increasing the preferredapplication size by 500k, reduced that time to only 6 minutes. <A HREF="tip14.shtml">MacTip #14</A> discusses the ins and outs of assigning memoryto your applications.</P><P><B>Fragmentation- </B>Fragmentation is a bigger issue than we will coverin this tip. We'll discuss it more in depth in an upcoming MacTip serieson maintenance. Fragmentation refers to the physical segmenting of fileson your hard drive. Over time as you use files on your hard drive they fillup the little space they are in and must be broken into 2 separate physicalpieces o your drive. This means that your hard drive must go to 2 placesto read the entire file instead of just one. With files that are constantlybeing added to and deleted from this fragmentation can decrease the performanceof your Mac. A few weeks ago I optimized my Duo. Optimization is the processof eliminating fragmentation. I found that the two files that contain myemail were segmented into over 800 separate pieces. In other words, if wantedto read through all my email, my hard drive would have to go to 800 separateplaces to get each piece so I could read it. After I optimized my hard drivethose files were all in one contiguous space on my drive and using my emailprogram moved along much faster.</P><P><A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/html/speeddoubler.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/sd8box.gif" WIDTH="71" HEIGHT="95" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" BORDER="0"></A><B>SpeedDoubler- </B>I know whether or not to use <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/html/speeddoubler.html">SpeedDoubler</A> has become a charged issue in some circles. Speed Doubler doesa number of things that will improve the performance of your PowerMac. Includingmaking your cache work more intelligently and making some operations ofthe Mac OS work faster by patching over the code from Apple and replacingit with code more suited to PowerMacs. The biggest drawback of Speed Doubleris that because it works so closely with the operating system most updatesfrom Apple will make it not work anymore. <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/">Connectix</A>has been great about providing updates and as long as you register yourcopy and keep an eye on their web site they will always come out with updatesin a timely fashion.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/sys8.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="../../images/fndr6icn.gif" WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Appropriate System Software- </B>A lot can be saidfor choosing the appropriate version of the Mac OS for your Mac. Most newerPowerMacs are going to get the best performance from the newest thing available.If you have an older Mac or PowerMac you probably won't get the best performancefrom the newest release from Apple. For example my Mac SE can run anythingfrom 6.0x to 7.5.5. I choose 7.1 for that machine because it provides thefunctionality I need but doesn't push the capabilities of the hardware.A 6100 series Mac might be happiest with 7.5.5 and your new 9600 will cruisealong nicely with Mac OS 8. If you are looking for that older system softwareit is available on <A HREF="ftp://ftp.info.apple.com/Apple.Support.Area/Apple.Software.Updates/US/Macintosh/System/Older_System/">Apple'sFTP site</A>.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H2>Make it feel faster...</H2><P>There are a few things you can do that won't help actual performanceat all but will make your Mac feel faster.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/mouseicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Mouse Speed- </B>The setting of you fast your cursormoves in relation to your mouse can make your Mac feel faster. If it takesyou less time to move the cursor from one side of the screen to the otheryou will work faster. As you become more proficient at mousing you gainmore control and can more effectively use the mouse a higher speeds.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/genctlicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Menu Blinking- </B>Menu blinking is the number oftimes the menu flashes after you select something from the menu. This isimportant feedback that lets you know you got the right one. However waitingthrough all those flashes may not be necessary for more advanced users.Setting the flash to 2,1, or none in your &quot;General Controls&quot; controlpanel can get you on your way to doing the next thing a split second sooner.Try it, see what you think.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/folder.gif" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>More Folders, Less Items- </B>Folders that containmany items can take a considerable amount of time to display on the screen.Sometimes it may be faster to have more folders that are more specific soyou can bypass those items that aren't what you desire. For example, insteadof having one folder that contains all of your applications you might breakthem into categories like Office, Publishing, Internet, Fun, Utilities,etc. This can especially be a help in working with network volumes withslow network access.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H2>Don't Slow it down.</H2><P>There are a few things that can slow down your Mac considerably and itis good to be aware of them. If you use one or more of these things it isgood to be aware of the performance hit you may be experiencing. I'm notsaying not to do these things. I am saying, be aware of the trade offs andmake an educated decision.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/viewopt.gif" WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="234" ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG SRC="../../images/viewicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Calculate Folder Sizes- </B>Thissetting was in the &quot;Views&quot; control panel prior to Mac OS 8 andis now in the &quot;View Options...&quot; for each folder. This option willtake a look in each folder and calculate the size of the items in that folder.This can be really handy for finding out where all your hard drive spacewent to, but it takes a lot of processor time accessing the hard disk (orlooking out on the network) for this information. My suggestion is to onlyhave it on when you need that specific information and leave it off therest of the time. If you are using Mac OS 8 you can selectively enable anddisable this on a folder by folder basis, thus allowing you to get thisinfo only from the places that you want it.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/netvolicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Unmount Unused Network Volumes- </B>One of the thingsthat makes the Mac OS so intuitive is that it is always keeping track ofevery volume that is mounted on your desktop. There is a constant conversationtaking place between the operating system and the volumes that are mounted.It goes something like this. &quot;Hey, volume X, you still there?&quot;,&quot;Yeah, I'm here.&quot;, &quot;Say, volume Y, you still there?&quot;,&quot;Yeah, I'm here too.&quot;, &quot;Yo! Volume Q, you still there?&quot;,&quot;Yup, I'm here.&quot; Although this is great for making sure what yousee on the screen reflects reality, all this chatter can keep your computerpretty busy. For local volumes like hard drives, CD-ROMs, Zip Disks andthe like this isn't a significant issue because they are always close andeasy to talk to. Where this can become an issue is with network volumes,especially if your network is a busy one. The best policy is to only mountnetwork volumes when you are going to be using them and to drag them tothe trash (or even better, select them and press command-y to put them away)when you are done. There is no sense in getting real caught up with mountingand unmounting network volumes all day but it does make sense to only mountthe ones you need for the time when you will need them.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/dtpicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Desktop Pictures- </B>Desktop pictures is one ofthe cool new features in Mac OS 8. For some Macs with limited ram or slowerprocessors Mac OS 8 created a big slow down in performance. Simply choosingan old fashioned desktop pattern can take up much less memory and thus improveperformance. If you notice that after switching to the Finder or closingwindows that the desktop picture takes a noticeable time to redraw you mightbe able to speed things up a little by removing it.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/aplmnuicn.gif" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Apple Menu Aliases- </B>I know this one will stepon a few toes but I think it is worth mentioning. Some people are in thehabit of making an alias of their hard drive and placing it in the AppleMenu Items folder in their System Folder. With the Apple Menu's hierarchicalmenus you can then easily navigate from the Apple Menu 5 layers deep toany place on your hard drive. Very cool trick! There is a down side though.The way the Apple Menu has all of that ready for you at a moments noticeis that it checks out before hand all the items that will be in that menuwhen you open it. Given that in this situation the bulk of your hard drivewill be in that menu there can be a considerable amount of information ofwhich it will need to keep track. Also any time something changes on yourhard drive, the Apple Menu will need to update to reflect the new information.I have seen situations where this single trick was responsible for slowingthings down dramatically. As always, if this is something you would liketo try or currently use, see how it works for you, try it with and without.The important factor is how your Mac works for you. If an alias in yourApple menu makes you more productive, great! Just be aware of the possibleside effects it can have to your system.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P ALIGN="CENTER">I'm sure there are many other things here and there that  can improve or degrade performance. The ones I've listed are the ones that  in my experience make the most significant impact for the majority of people.  If you have thoughts about other ways to improve the overall performance  of your Mac at little or no cost I'd love to hear  about them. I hope these thoughts will help you squeeze those last  few megahertz out of your Mac.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>      <H4 ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</H4><H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><TT>Tip #26 apeared October 23rd 1997.</TT></H4>      <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Bottom navbar.lbi" --><HR SIZE="4" align="CENTER"><p align=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><a href="http://www.themacintoshguy.com/">The Macintosh Guy</a> || <a href="../">MacTips</a> || <a href="../../lists/">Email Lists</a> || <a href="http://roguelane.com/blog/">My Blog</a><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p><hr size="4" align="CENTER"><div align="LEFT">    <i><font size="-1">This site, its source code, and the MacTips logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice..
