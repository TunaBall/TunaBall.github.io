The first saysmake it as fast as possible as soon as possible. So as soon as you takeit out of the box you fill it with RAM, another hard drive, video cardsand anything else that might possibly make you computing experience a littlebit brighter. The second says only upgrade when you feel the need.</P><P>If money is not a factor there may be no reason not to just upgrade everythingpossible right away, but I see some benefits in taking the slower road tocomputing bliss.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>We upgrade for pleasure and productivity.</H3><P>We talk about upgrades in terms of Mhz and performance gain but reallymost of the time we upgrade because either we just get fed up waiting, orwe think what we add will give us more pleasure. It is important to makesure we are realizing performance gains when we are upgrading, but equallyimportant is that we can feel that gain in performance. Every upgrade Imake to my Mac I want to be able to specifically identify the differencespending that money made. The following suggestions are geared toward helpingyou get the most out of every upgrade, as small as it might be.</P><P><B>Exhaust all software solutions.</B></P><P>Many times when we have that feeling of slowness the first thing we willturn to is a hardware upgrade. Many times the most significant performancegains can be found through maintenance and proper configuration.</P><P><B>Where is it slow?</B></P><P>Many times I hear, &quot;My Mac is just too slow.&quot; I always respondthe question of what exactly about it is too slow. Identifying what theexact point when you feel your Mac being slow is a big step in decidingwhat needs to be upgraded. Is it when you are opening applications, performingcertain operations, switching between programs, starting up, getting email,viewing web pages, transferring files from a server, calculating your taxdebt, or playing Marathon? Once you can isolate the specific operationsthat are most important to speed up, not only will you be better able todecide what to upgrade, you will have specific things on which to evaluatehow well your upgrade went.</P><P><B>Identify specific needs.</B></P><P>Once you have identified the specific operations that give you the feelingof slowness, the next step is to try to figure out what exactly is goingon at that point. Are you accessing the hard drive? Are you transferringthings over a modem or the network? Is your processor just chugging away?This is the place where it can take some experience to tell exactly whatis going on and more importantly why. Just because your hard drive is workingreally hard it doesn't mean you necessarily need a faster hard drive. Thekey is that you would need to find out what is possible to  gceive the burdenon your hard drive. This could involve a number of things including moreRAM, a L2 cache, or even just adjusting the amount of memory allocated toa specific application.</P><P><B>It pays to wait.</B></P><P>I often encourage people who are even just a little on the fence aboutwhether they should upgrade to wait. With price and performance points changingas fast as they are right now, you can almost always benefit from waiting.The difference of just a few months can often make the difference of quitea few dollars or Mhz. There are certainly situations where you find a greatdeal and jumping on it is the best thing to do. All things being equal,waiting is usually better than not.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3><IMG SRC="../../images/formula.gif" WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="112" ALIGN="RIGHT">The Formula.</H3><P>Current Macs are largely very open for upgrades as compared to the nottoo distant past. This is great because it makes it easier to get into asystem in the first place and leaves you some room for adding value alongthe way. When you get to the point of wanting to upgrade your Mac it iscertainly possible that there will be a number of options at your disposal.Deciding what specifically to upgrade can be a daunting task. The goal ofmost every user is to add the most value for the least cost. I see thisas fundamental.</P><P>In upgrading my own computers and assisting others in upgrading theirsI have come to think of a few factors that help me decide or recommend whichspecific upgrade will provide the best value.</P><P><B>Gain</B></P><P>Gain is the term I use to represent the benefit that the particular upgradewill provide. Many times we speak of thing in terms of hard percentagesor even Mhz. I consider gain in the broader sense of the added pleasureor productivity that the particular upgrade will provide for you.</P><P>For example you might realize a 200% performance gain from a processorupgrade but if your hard drive is crammed full, a new hard drive would beof greater benefit than more processing power. Another example might beone in which adding a video card might provide you with more colors andincrease your computing experience and provide you with more value thansomething like a level 2 cache that would increase the speed of your computer.</P><P>Another aspect of gain also includes any negatives of a specific upgrade.Examples of this include situations where you might have to remove a certainelement like a RAM chip to replace it with a larger one. So even thoughyou might be installing a 32 megabyte ram chip, if you must remove a 4 megabytechip your net gain is only 28 megabytes. Gain takes into account what youmay loose in an upgrade like removing RAM chips or a hard drive to makeroom for the new one. Think of gain as the net positive effect of your upgradewhich might include better performance.</P><P><B>Longevity</B></P><P>Longevity speaks to the amount of time that you will be able to takeadvantage of a specific upgrade. For example if you filled your last 2 memoryslots with only 8 megabytes of ram you might need to replace them in a yearwith a pair of 16 megabyte chips thus only giving the 8 megabyte upgradea longevity of a year. Many upgrades can last the life of your computerbut it is important to consider what your needs might be in a year or twowhen performing upgrades now. The more longevity a particular upgrade hasthe more value it holds for you.</P><P><B>Cost</B></P><P>Cost is a simple yet significant factor to consider in each upgrade.Cost is different than price, cost involves not only price but your budget.The more a specific upgrade fits into your budget the lower the cost. Ifa specific upgrade would stretch your budget the cost would be high. Ifyou happen to have a ton of extra money even something with a high pricecould have a relatively low cost.</P><P><B>Putting it all together.</B></P><P>These three factors, gain, longevity and cost determine the value ofa particular upgrade. When considering an upgrade for myself or a clientI mentally put these factors into a formula that helps to determine whichupgrades make the most sense for the individual.</P><P>Although I haven't taken the time to actually try to figure out applyingnumbers to the formula the principles can help to compare different upgradeoptions to determine which one would provide the best value for you.</P><P>Basically the top part of the formula (Gain times Longevity) is a representationof the fact that the value of an upgrade is enhanced by the fact that thelonger you can take advantage of it. The bottom part of the formula (Cost)speaks to the fact that the overall value of an upgrade is reduced by whatit costs you.</P><P>I don't claim that this formula in itself will make the decision on whatto upgrade an easy one. What this formula does do for you, is it allowsyou to think of the impact a certain upgrade in a manner that will walkyou through the positives and negatives. The way I do it is to look at gain,longevity and cost for each option I have and by the time I have consideredall my options I will begin to have one that seems like a better value thanthe others.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>I hope this MacTip gives you some tools that can help you to consider  each option at your disposal decide which one will provide you with the  best value. In some future MacTips we will begin to discuss the effects  of some specific hardware upgrades.</P>  <P ALIGN="RIGHT">Eric Prentice</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><HR></H4><H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><TT>Tip #27 apeared November 11th 1997.</TT></H4>      <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Bottom navbar.lbi" --><HR SIZE="4" align="CENTER"><p align=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><a href="http://www.themacintoshguy.com/">The Macintosh Guy</a> || <a href="../">MacTips</a> || <a href="../../lists/">Email Lists</a> || <a href="http://roguelane.com/blog/">My Blog</a><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p><hr size="4" align="CENTER"><div align="LEFT">    <i><font size="-1">This site, its source code, and the MacTips logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice..
