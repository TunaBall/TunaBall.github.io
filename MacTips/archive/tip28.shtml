In most computersthe hard drive is the slowest piece of hardware that information flows through.This MacTip discusses the things you need to consider when upgrading yourhard drive.</P><H3>Bigger, Faster, or Both?</H3><P><IMG SRC="../../images/nodiskspace.gif" WIDTH="336" HEIGHT="132" ALIGN="RIGHT">Most often when people talk about upgradingtheir hard drive it is because of <B>lack of space</B>. Really there area two primary situations where it might make sense to upgrade your harddrive. The first being the obvious reason of lack of space and the secondfor <B>increased performance</B>.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/fndrwndo.gif" WIDTH="303" HEIGHT="125" ALIGN="RIGHT">It is easy to tell when you have run out of space onyour drive. Many of us start to notice our drives are full when we can'tsave something we're working on or we start getting errors somewhere. GenerallyI like to keep an eye on my free space so I can plan ahead before gettingthose disk full errors begin to occur. The easiest way to keep on top ofyour current disk status is to have the amount of available space shownon the top of every finder window.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/viewicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT">If you are using system software older than system 8,click the <B>&quot;Show disk info in header&quot; </B>check box in the <B>&quot;Views&quot;</B>control panel and every Finder window not just the ones that are in largeicon view. If you are using Mac OS 8 simply look at <B>the top of any Finderwindow </B>and you will see how much room you have left on any particulardrive.</P><P>It is always a good idea to make sure that you leave at least a few megabytesof free space on your drive. Just leaving a little extra room can go a longway in keeping your machine stable and your data safe.</P><P>The other reason to replace or add a hard drive is if you are in a situationwhere you have done everything possible to increase the performance of yourmachine and you want a <B>little extra speed boost</B>. If your machineis behaving slow, as always, there are a number of things to look into beforeconsidering hardware upgrades. Fragmentation (an upcoming topic), excessiveextensions, and other things can really bog down a drive, so be sure toexplore all your options before jumping on a new hard drive. Most peopleupgrade their hard drives for storage reasons but get a faster one whilethey are at it for reasons of performance. Be sure to check out MacTip #26 &quot;<A HREF="tip26.shtml">Squeeze out those last few Mhz!</A>&quot;to make sure you have exhausted all software options before diving intosome new hardware.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Where to put it?</H3><P>If you decide it is time for a new hard drive a big consideration iswhere to install it. If the case of your Mac is flat like a pizza box oris only a few inches thick you more than likely only have room for a singlehard drive in your Mac. So an upgrade would mean either replacing the oneyou have or getting a drive in an external case. If you have a larger Mac,especially one in a tower case you should have room for one or more drivesin addition to the one that came with your machine.</P><P>The value of an <B>internal drive</B> is that you don't have to dealwith any more cables or devices on your desk. Also some Macs can accessinternal hard drives faster than external drive. Because they don't requirea case and extra cables they are usually $70-$100 cheaper than their externalcounterparts.</P><P>The value of <B>external drives</B> are that they are easy to install,just a couple cables to plug in. They are portable so you can easily movethem between machines or locations. External drives are often a good choiceif you are thinking of upgrading to a new computer any time soon so youcan be sure to easily transfer the drive to your new machine.</P><P>Another issue that can be a deciding factor for an external drive isthat if you only have space for one internal drive, you need to have a wayto transfer the information from your current drive to the new one. If youhave a Zip drive or other way to back up your information this may not bean issue, if not, an external may be your best option.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>SCSI vs. IDE</H3><P>There are basically two different ways that Macs communicate with harddrives, <B>SCSI</B> (Small Computer Standard Interface) or <B>IDE</B> (IntegratedDrive Electronics). Both protocols serve the same purpose of getting informationfrom your hard drive to your computer but they simply do it in differentmanners. Up until the last couple years all Mac hard drives were SCSI. SCSIis great because it makes connecting new devices to your Mac very easy.There is no reason you can't have a scanner, hard drive, zip drive, CD driveand other devices connected to your Mac through the SCSI port, all at thesame time. SCSI has been an integral part of almost every Mac. Even still,most PCs don't come equipped with SCSI. To put it another way, you can probablybuy a used Mac with SCSI for about what it can cost to get a SCSI card fora PC.</P><P>Because SCSI is a standard interface, you can purchase <B>just aboutany SCSI drive</B> and make it work with your Mac. You don't need to worryabout who made it to make sure it will be compatible.</P><P>Many of the Performas came with IDE drives, but also have connectionsfor internal SCSI devices. If you are adding an additional hard drive internally.itusually makes sense to go with a SCSI drive. If you are replacing your internaldrive you may have a choice of SCSI or IDE.</P><P>It is important to know what kind of hard drive you currently have inyour Mac if you are considering replacing it. Most Macs come with SCSI drivesinternally. There are some however that came with IDE drives. IDE has generallybeen the standard in the PC world for a long time. IDE drives can be lessexpensive but they don't offer the same flexibility as SCSI. If you arereplacing an IDE drive be sure you are getting it from a dealer who is familiarwith Macs because not all IDE drives will work with Macs. Most Macs thathave internal IDE drives also have internal SCSI connectors so they canhandle IDE or SCSI.</P><P>According to <A HREF="http://til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/14b806f5b63e5c3386256495005accbb/d85d5631aee8baf5862565140071dadd?OpenDocument">anarticle</A> in Apple's <A HREF="http://til.info.apple.com/">Technical InfoLibrary</A> the following machines shipped with IDE hard drives. If youhave one of these machines be sure to check into what options you have forinstalling a new one.</P><P><TABLE WIDTH="419" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0" HEIGHT="130"><TR><TD WIDTH="50%" HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;Macintosh 630 Family</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">&nbsp;Macintosh LC 580</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="50%" HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;Macintosh Performa 5200 series</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">&nbsp;Macintosh Performa 5300 series</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="50%" HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;Macintosh Performa 6200 series</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">&nbsp;Macintosh Performa 6300 series</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="50%" HEIGHT="16">&nbsp;Macintosh PowerBook 150 series</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">&nbsp;Macintosh PowerBook 190 series</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="50%" HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;Macintosh PowerBook 2300 series</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">&nbsp;Macintosh PowerBook 5300 series</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="50%" HEIGHT="16">&nbsp;Power Macintosh 5200/75 LC</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">&nbsp;Power Macintosh 5300/100 LC</TD></TR></TABLE><p></P><H3>Making sense of the numbers.</H3><P>Unless you have some new, tricked out, screamin' Mac, speed is probablyof concern to you. Although a faster hard drive won't make your old dinosaurinto a speed demon, it can add some spunk to your tired Mac or take yourcurrent Mac to the next level.</P><P>In considering the performance of hard drives there are typically twoprimary factors that you should consider. Those are access time and transferrate.</P><P><B>Access time</B> is measured in the number of milliseconds it takesthe drive to get to the first piece of information after it has been requested.These are generally in the range of high single digits to the low teens.A 6 to 8 ms access time is considered pretty quick, 9.5 to 10.5 is prettytypical and anything higher than 12 is beginning to be considered a littlepokey.</P><P><B>Transfer rate</B> is another significant factor in hard drive performance.This is the amount of data that hard drive can push out. This is measuredin megabytes per second. It is important to consider both what your needsare and what your machine is capable of when looking at this number.</P><P>One other number that you will often see in marketing brochures is the<B>spin rate or RPM </B>(Revolutions Per Minute). This is simply the numberof times that the hard disk in your hard drive spins around in a minute.Generally the faster the spin rate the faster the drive will be able totransfer information. Spin rates of 5400 RPM are pretty typical and ratesof 7200 and 10,000 RPM are reserved for higher end drives. The spin ratein itself is not too significant in itself. What the higher spin rates providefor you will show up in the access time and transfer rate.</P><P>The only other number that might be of significance is the <B>MTBF orMean Time Between Failures</B>. Although this number has never effectedmy decision making for a personal machine, it can come into play if youare purchasing a drive for a server or other high load computers. MTBF issimply the average estimated amount of time in use before a drive fails.This number may be interesting to know but really there is no hard drivethat you can purchase today that shouldn't give you years of effective service.</P><P>There are of course t<B>ons of other figures</B> that you will see tossedaround when referring to hard drives, some might be important to you, othersare just fluff. Unless you are doing something out of the ordinary, if youpay attention to only <B>Access Time and Transfer Rate</B> you should youshould find a drive that would be suited to your needs.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>The drive for you and your Mac.</H3><P>When considering upgrading your hard drive you need to consider bothyour needs and the capabilities of your computer.</P><P>As mentioned in MacTip #27 <A HREF="tip27.shtml">Upgrade Theory 101</A>,there will always be a number of options to you when considering an upgrade.As far as hard drives go the <B>two factors that primarily influence priceare speed and capacity</B>. It isn't unusual to find a one or two gigabyte(a gigabyte is 1,000 megabytes) hard drive for a couple hundred dollarsand it is also easy to find larger and faster drives for $1000 and up.</P><P>The key is to figure out what <B>your needs</B> are and find a drivethe is best suited to those needs. If most of your time is spent in textbased applications, the speed of your drive may be a secondary considerationto capacity. If you spend your computing time mostly on graphics, or games,a drive with a little kick to it may go a long way towards increasing yourproductivity. (Yes, I did use games and productivity in the same sentence.)On the the farther ends of the spectrum, if you are dealing with somethingthat requires you to have access to a large amount of information at once,you might opt for a larger drive. If you are doing something like editingvideo or audio you might need both breakneck speed and tons of disk space.</P><P>The important thing is to l<B>ook at how you use your computer</B>. Nexttime you feel like you are waiting for your computer take a listen and seeif you can tell what it is doing. If you hear the hard drive chatteringthe whole time you might not have to wait as long if you had a faster drive.</P><P>Of equal importance to your needs are the <B>capabilities of your computer</B>.The first consideration is <B>install location</B>. We discussed earliersome of the considerations of whether you have another bay in which to installan additional drive or if you will need to replace your current one or purchasean external drive. Another consideration is the <B>cooling capacity</B>of your computer. Most newer Macs that have room for an additional drivealso have enough cooling power. Newer hard drives can put out a significantamount of heat. Some, while operating can be too hot to touch. If you arereplacing a drive in an older Mac you should consider the amount of heatthat a newer drive can create and make sure that you either get one thatdoesn't create a significant amount of heat or that your Mac has sufficientcooling power.</P><P>The next thing to consider about your Mac is the <B>speed of the SCSIbus</B>. Most PowerPC based Macs have a SCSI bus that can function at 5or 10 mb per second. Given that the drives that come in many Macs can onlyput out 1-4 mb per second an upgrade in some cases could certainly providea significant improvement in performance. Also some Macs have differentspeed buses depending on if you are connecting the drive internally or externally.If performance is of any concern to you it is important to match your Macwith a drive that will make best use of your SCSI bus. Likewise, knowingwhat your Mac is capable of will save you from spending money on a fasterdrive than your Mac can handle. <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</A>has a slightly <A HREF="http://til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/artnum/n12315">outdatedarticle</A> in its <A HREF="http://til.info.apple.com/">Technical Info Library</A>that lists the <A HREF="http://til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/artnum/n12315">speedof many Macs SCSI busses</A>.</P><P><B>Cabling</B> is another thing to consider when looking at hard drives.Most Macs come with a standard 50-pin internal SCSI cable already set upto accommodate the empty bays inside the case of your computer. Most manufacturersand sellers of hard drives should be able to let you now everything youwould need and be happy to sell it to you too.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Installation</H3><P>If you decide on an <B>external hard drive</B> installation is a snap.Simply add the hard drive to your SCSI port on the back of your Mac, plugin the power and your are all set. (I'm not going to go into all the issuesof SCSI like IDs, in this MacTip, be sure to read the instructions thatcome with your drive.)</P><P><B>Installation of an internal drive</B> is usually pretty straight forward.If you are replacing your internal drive most hard drives come set withthe <B>SCSI ID to zero</B> and <B>the drive terminated</B> so you can justreplace the stock one and be on your way. Also when replacing a drive youcan just remove the mounting brackets from the old drive and use them onthe new one. If you are adding a hard drive into an <B>empty bay</B> youneed to make sure to update the SCSI ID and termination accordingly. Youwill also need to purchase mounting hardware for your specific Mac. Allhard drive resellers should be able to sell you these, many come with thedrive for no extra charge.</P><P>Before you can use your new hard drive you will need to format it soyour Mac will know how to communicate with it. Many new hard drives comewith the necessary software such are <A HREF="http://www.fwb.com/">HardDisk Toolkit</A>, <A HREF="http://www.apstech.com/">APS PowerTools</A>,etc. Apple also recently updated its drive formatting tool, Drive Set Upto work with many non Apple drives. Given the choice, I always prefer usingDrive Set Up to any of the third party options. Daniel Knight of Low-End-Machas a list of <A HREF="http://www.mactimes.com/lowend/drivesetup.html">drivessupported by Drive Set Up</A>. Also when you are formatting a drive youneed to consider partitioning. Check out MacTips Tip #10 <A HREF="tip10.shtml">HardDrive Partitioning, Part(ition) 1</A>, and #11 <A HREF="tip11.shtml">HardDrive Partitioning, Part(ition) 2</A> for information about partitioning.</P><P>If you do replace your internal drive with a new one you might want tokeep the old one in case you upgrade to a newer Mac and want to move yournew drive to your new Mac it might be nice to have the old one to put backin before you sell it or pass it on.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P ALIGN="RIGHT">I hope this MacTip has helped you to understand hard drive  upgrades a bit better, be sure to let me know if you use any of this info  in upgrading your Mac.</P>      <p>&nbsp;</p></BLOCKQUOTE><H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><TT>Tip #28 apeared December 18th 1997.</TT></H4>      <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Bottom navbar.lbi" --><HR SIZE="4" align="CENTER"><p align=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><a href="http://www.themacintoshguy.com/">The Macintosh Guy</a> || <a href="../">MacTips</a> || <a href="../../lists/">Email Lists</a> || <a href="http://roguelane.com/blog/">My Blog</a><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p><hr size="4" align="CENTER"><div align="LEFT">    <i><font size="-1">This site, its source code, and the MacTips logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice..
