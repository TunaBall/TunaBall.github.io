This week we are going to discuss the Disk Cache.</P>      <P><B>Keep it handy. </B>One of the keys to getting the best performance         out of your Macintosh is a principle that you probably use every day.         That is keep things you need handy. You keep your pencil holder on your         desk, your keys by the front door, your wallet in your pocket or in your         purse and your floppy disks by your computer. Why? Because you know that         you will be the most efficient if the things you need are closest to you         when you need them.</P>      <P><B>The same principle in computing. </B>Apple has thought of this too.         What your 'Disk Cache' does is essentially the same as you do, it keeps         things handy. When your computer does an action it needs to read the information         off your hard drive which involves a spinning plate of metal that needs         to be spun to the right spot and the information needs to be read off         it. Not unlike the old LPs where the needle has to get to the right place         on the record before you get to hear the latest hit. All these moving         parts means that this can be a slow process. (That is, slow in computing         terms meaning fractions of a second) So what Apple does is tries to put         the information in a place where is can be accessed more easily. This         place is in the RAM (Random Access Memory) memory of your computer.</P>      <P><B>The Quest for Information.</B></P>      <P>In Power Macs when a piece of information is called for these are four         options where the information may be.</P>      <P>1. The Level 1 cache. All Power PC processors have a small portion of         memory built into the actual chip itself, usually about 32K. Older Macintoshes         don't have this L1 cache. This is the first place your computer will look         for the information. if the information is not found there it moves on         to the second place.</P>      <P>2. The Level 2 cache. Many Macintosh computers have the option of having         a L2 cache, these usually run between 256K and 1 mb. This is actually         a chip that is plugged into the main logic board. Having one of these         can really improve performance of your Macintosh. Usually about 10-15%.         If your computer can't find the information it seeks here it will move         on to the third spot.</P>      <P>3. The Disk Cache (our topic for this week) is the next place your computer         will look for what it needs. The size of your disk cache is decided by         you in your memory control panel. See below for recommended settings.         And if your computer doesn't find what it needs here it will move to the         fourth option.</P>      <P>4. The hard drive. This is the slowest option, remember all those moving         parts? If your computer has to go to the hard drive for everything it         needs you will have a very slow computer.</P>      <P><B>A good general </B>rule for the setting of your 'Disk Cache' is 32K         for every megabyte of real RAM you have. The chart below offers a good         starting point.</P>      <P ALIGN="LEFT">       <TABLE WIDTH="51%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0">        <TR>           <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Disk Cache Settings</B></TD>        </TR>      </TABLE>      <TABLE WIDTH="51%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0" HEIGHT="179" align="CENTER">        <TR>           <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;Amount of RAM</TD>          <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;Disk Cache Setting</TD>        </TR>        <TR>           <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;4 MB</TD>          <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;128K</TD>        </TR>        <TR>           <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;8 MB</TD>          <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;256K</TD>        </TR>        <TR>           <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;12 MB</TD>          <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;384K</TD>        </TR>        <TR>           <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;16 MB</TD>          <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;512K</TD>        </TR>        <TR>           <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;24 MB</TD>          <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;768K</TD>        </TR>        <TR>           <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;32 MB</TD>          <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;1024K</TD>        </TR>        <TR>           <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;64 MB</TD>          <TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;2048K</TD>        </TR>      </TABLE>      <div align="CENTER">      </div>      <div align="CENTER">      <p>&nbsp;</p></div>      <div align="CENTER">      </div>      <p></P>      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>More is not always better. </B>There are times when         it may be beneficial to set your disk cache larger that the table above         suggests but setting it larger may also slow your computer down because         it has more memory to keep track of. Your best bet is to set it as the         table suggests and see how it goes. Try a bit more or less and see if         you can tell the difference.</P>      <P ALIGN="CENTER">If you adjust your disk cache, I'd love to hear about it and if you feel it helped you in any way. <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Bottom navbar.lbi" --><HR SIZE="4" align="CENTER"><p align=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><a href="http://www.themacintoshguy.com/">The Macintosh Guy</a> || <a href="../">MacTips</a> || <a href="../../lists/">Email Lists</a> || <a href="http://roguelane.com/blog/">My Blog</a><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p><hr size="4" align="CENTER"><div align="LEFT">    <i><font size="-1">This site, its source code, and the MacTips logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice..
