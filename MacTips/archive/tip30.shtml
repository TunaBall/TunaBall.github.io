Macs were really the first computersthat made creating a network easy. All Macs since very early on have beennetworkable. Depending on the age of your computers, creating a simple twocomputer network may be as simple as getting a $10 dollar cable and pluggingthem in.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><B>Disclaimer...</B> This MacTip is intended to be an introduction to  Macintosh networking. There are literally hundreds of combinations of software,  hardware, protocols, cabling and terminology that can be used in networking.  This MacTip covers the information that most people would need to get started  in creating a small home or office network.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><H4>Is My Mac Networkable?</H4><P>If you are reading this on your Mac the answer is yes. Practically everyMac is networkable, if your Mac is new enough to have a hard drive it canbe networked.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4>Are There Different Kinds of Networks?</H4><P>In speaking of Macs generally there are two kinds of networks that areprimarily used, <B>Ethernet</B> and <B>LocalTalk</B>.</P><P>Most every Mac can be a part of a <B>LocalTalk network</B>. LocalTalknetworks connect to your Mac through the Printer port. To create a simpleLocalTalk network you can simply connect a standard printer cable to theprinter ports of two Macs and you have a slow but effective network. Thisis an easy way to transfer information between two computers. If you onlyneed to periodically need to connect two computers, especially if one orboth of them isn't ethernet capable, this is a great way to move informationaround.</P><P>On a LocalTalk network if you want to connect more than two devices (i.e.a few Macs and a printer) you end up setting them up in a chain with oneconnected to the next to the next.</P><P><B>Ethernet networks</B> are what most businesses use for networking.Ethernet is considerably faster than LocalTalk. A file that takes only acouple minutes to copy from one computer to another through ethernet couldeasily take a half an hour or more through LocalTalk. Many PowerMacs andQuadras have ethernet capabilities built-in, we'll discuss later how totell what networking capabilities you have on your Mac.</P><P>Ethernet networks of more than 2 devices are generally set-up in moreof a star or octopus with a hub (see below) in the center with cables runningout to each computer or printer.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4>Why Network?</H4><P>Some of you maybe wondering why you would want to network your Macs.The biggest reason is <B>file sharing</B>. File sharing allows you to accesspart or all of another Macs hard drive as if it were physically a part ofthat machine. When you access the other computers hard drive, it shows upon your desktop just like any other drive or disk.</P><P>More than just file sharing. There are also a number of other thingsthat you can do with a network. Other than file sharing I have a feelingthat the second most frequent use of networks are for <B><A HREF="http://cafe.ambrosiasw.com/netgames/">networkcomputer games</A></B>. Many games have the capability for two or more peopleto play with or against each other. I must admit I've spent a little timepounding the keys trying to <A HREF="http://www.bungie.com/products/trilogy/">annihilatea co-worker or two</A> in the past.</P><P>A network is also a good way to allow more than one Mac access a singleprinter.</P><P>Simple networks can also be used to <B>share databases</B>, <B>communicate</B>between two rooms of the house, <B>back-up one computer</B> to another,or just to move yourself one more step up the <B><A HREF="http://www.emergency.com/technerd.htm">techno-nerdladder</A></B>.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4>The Hardware?</H4><P><B>Computers</B> - Obviously the most significant part of any computernetwork are the computers. The first thing to look at is what kind of networkingyour Mac is capable of. You can take the time to pull out the manual thatcame with your Mac but you can also just pull it out and take a look atthe back of your machine. At this point you will be trying to identify whatsort of connections you have built-in on your Mac. If you take a look atthe back of your Mac you will see a number of ports along the back of yourMac.</P><P><B>Ports</B> -The port is simply the point at which you connect yournetwork cabling to the computer. The type of port you use depends on thekind of network you are using.</P><P><B>Printer Port</B> - Every Mac comes with a printer port. It will bethe one with the little printer icon next to it. If you are using a <B>LocalTalknetwork</B> you will be using the Printer port to connect to your network.</P><P><B>RJ-45 Ethernet port</B>- Many newer Macintoshes that are ethernetcapable (really any of the PCI based PowerMacs) now come with both AAUIand RJ-45 ports. Also many third party add-on network cards come with RJ-45ports. RJ-45 looks like a fat telephone connector and functions as simplyas most standard telephone cords.</P><P><B>AAUI Ethernet Port</B>- Many Macs have shipped with an AAUI ethernetport. Looking at the back of your machine you may have a port that is labeledwith what looks something like &quot;&lt;--&gt;&quot; and is sometimes nextto an RJ-45 port. This port was what many Macs came with as the standardethernet connector. To use this connection you need what is called a transceiver.A transceiver simply converts the AAUI connection to a RJ-45 connection.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Cable</B>- Depending on the kind of network you choose you have theoptions for a number of different types cable.</P><P><B>LocalTalk</B>- If you choose a LocalTalk network your point of contactfor the network will be the printer port of each Mac. If you only need toconnect two Macs a simple printer cable will do the trick for you. Thiscable is often referred to as an ImageWriter II cable because the ImageWriterII was the first Apple printer to use that cable. It may also be referredto as a mini-din 8 cable. If you are looking at hooking up more then twoMacs on a LocalTalk network you will need to purchase one of the more expandablesolutions. Probably the most popular is what is called PhoneNet. PhoneNetconsists of an adapter for each Mac or printer that has two ports for standardtelephone cables to run between each device forming a chain. This is a greatsolution because the cables are inexpensive and readily available.</P><P><B>Ethernet</B>- If you choose an ethernet network your cabling optionsare all pretty similar. In the past many different types of cable were used.Everything from coaxial cable (like the kind that most cable TV companiesuse to bring their service to your home) to flat linear cable. Now daysthe standard is called twisted pair. It gets its name from the 4 sets ofwires that are twisted within the wire. The twisting decreases the wiressusceptibility to picking up stray radio signals that can cause problemswith your network. Twisted pair wiring comes in different quality categories.Category 5 is generally the quality that is used although the slightly cheaperCategory 3 wire is fairly common. If you are in a position of buying cablingthe extra reliability of Category 5 is worth the small added cost. Reallyit is only if you are using mass amounts of cable that the price differencecould add up but for most home or small office networks the small pricedifference is worth the extra security. Also many times the manufacturerof the specific cables may be more or less particular about quality. Althoughmost cables will work when they are initially tested, if they are goingto be in a position where they will be inserted and removed on a regularbasis (like one connecting a laptop to a desktop when it is not on the road)you may want to not get the cheapest one available. Because of the widerange in quality of workmanship of ethernet cables I regularly make my ownfor my customers. That way I can be sure of the quality they are getting.</P><P>Ethernet cables are similar to the phone cable that connects your telephoneto the wall except the RJ-45 connectors are a bit wider.</P><P>Ethernet actually only uses 4 of the 8 wires in standard ethernet cable.Two of those wires are used for talking to other computers and two for listeningto them. The fact that ethernet uses specific wires for talking and listeningyou can't simply connect a cable between two Macs and have them communicate.What happens in that case is that both computers try to talk on the samewires and listen on the same wires. Part of the purpose of a hub (see below)is to perform the switching so that each Mac can talk and listen to allthe others. Don't have a hub? You can use a specially made cable that hasthose wires crossed to allow two Macs to communicate through one cable withoutthe need for a hub. These cables are called cross-talkcables and are usually available for about $10. This is ideal if youhave two Macs that you want to connect. It provides all the performanceof ethernet without the need for a more expensive hub and is easy to connectand disconnect whenever you might need it.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Perhaps a Hub?</B> If your Macs are ethernet capable and you wantto connect more than 2 computers (or printers) at a time you will need whatis called a hub. A hub is a device that handles the communication betweeneach device on a ethernet network. Ethernet hubs come in standard sizeswith a number of ports (usually RJ-45), one for each device on the network.There are mini-hubs that come with 4 or 5 ports, larger hubs with 24 ormore ports for more serious networks and everything in between. Mini-hubscan be purchased for around $50 or $60, larger hubs can easily cost over$1000. If you are wanting to have some room for your network to grow inthe future you may want to consider getting a hub that has more ports thanyou currently need.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4>Performance?</H4><P>When considering the performance of a network there are actually twofactors with which you need to concern yourself. The first is the speedat which you will be able to transfer information and the second is howwell your computer performs while transferring information.</P><P>Although when compared to even today's fast modems <B>LocalTalk</B> mayseem a bit speedy. LocalTalk is slow no matter how you look at it when usedfor transferring files. Generally the limit of a LocalTalk networks abilityto transfer information is about 30k per second, about 10 times as fastas a 33.6 modem. That equates to about 75 megabytes an hour. The other significantfactor is that while a LocalTalk network is in use most computers will benoticeably slower or even unusable during file transfers.</P><P>As far as <B>ethernet</B> if you have it built into your Mac you havewhat is called 10BaseT (pronounced &quot;Ten-Base-Tee&quot;). Only the newesthigh end Macs come with 100BaseT which is quite a bit faster. The upperlimit of 10BaseT ethernet is about 1 megabyte per second which translatesto a little over a minute for the same amount of data that would take aLocalTalk transfer about an hour. 100BaseT is even faster still althoughnot ten times faster than 10BaseT.</P><P>If you are considering a network, 10BaseT ethernet will more than likelymeet you needs for a while to come. Generally 100BaseT is only used forthose who are transferring significant amounts of data where ultra highspeeds are necessary. The cost factor is still significant enough that itis really only used for specific applications.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4>I Want Ethernet!</H4><P>If after seeing some of the advantages of ethernet you see that the built-inLocalTalk capabilities of your Mac just won't cut the mustard don't worry.Just about every Mac can be equipped with ethernet capabilities. If youhave a newer PCI Mac you can simply install an ethernet card in one of theslots to provide that functionality. If you have a more mature (i.e. older)Mac you con more than likely install a NuBus card or an ethernet card inthe communications slot. These cards range from about $15 for a used cardfor you vintage Mac to about $50 for a PCI card for you new PowerMac.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Hey! What about my Printer?</B></P><P>The most common hurdle when setting up a network for someone is the issueof getting their printer on the network. Very few printers, except thoseat the high end support ethernet right out of the box. Many personal printersdon't support networking at all. If your printer is <B>LocalTalk</B> capableit may be an easy thing to add it to <B>LocalTalk network</B>. Simply pluggingit into the network instead of directly from an individual computer shouldallow it to show up on the network. If you are setting up an ethernet networkand you have a LocalTalk printer you will need a piece of hardware to bridgebetween the LocalTalk capabilities of your printer and the ethernet of yournetwork. These adapters or transceivers convert the information that isbeing sent over ethernet into something your LocalTalk printer will understand.These transceivers usually run around $300 and are available from most ofthe mail order catalogs and should be available from your local Macintoshretailer. They are a bit pricey but usually much cheaper than buying anethernet capable printer.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4>The Software?</H4><P><IMG SRC="../../images/appltlkicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT">With the advent of System 7.5.3 Apple released <B>OpenTransport </B>(OT). OT changed the way the Mac OS looks at networking. Inaddition to increasing the performance of LocalTalk networks Apple alsosimplified much software required for setting it up any network.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/AppleTalk.gif" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="150" ALIGN="RIGHT">The easy way to tell whether you are using OT or Classicnetworking is to take a look at your control panels. If you have an 'AppleTalk'control panel you are using Open Transport. If you have a 'Network' controlpanel you are using Classic networking.</P><P>Getting your computer to recognize the network is usually as easy asgoing into the 'Network' or 'AppleTalk' and selecting the kind of networkyou are using.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/Network.gif" WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="159" ALIGN="LEFT">If for some reason you don't see an option for the kindof networking you are hooked into you you may need to make sure your networkingsoftware if installed or enabled.</P><P>Another cause of an option not showing up would be that you may be usinga third party network card that requires software from the manufacturer.More often than not you can download the software from their web sites.If you are not sure which network card your Mac has you may be able to tellby looking at it from the outside of your Mac. Unfortunately most of themrequire you to open the case of your machine and actually look at the carditself to see who made it. Once you know the manufacturer you can contactthem for everything you need to make use of that card.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4>Seeing the Network.</H4><P><IMG SRC="../../images/choosericn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT">Once you have all the hardware connected the next stepis to try to &quot;see&quot; the other computers or printers on the network.Every Mac's window to the outside world in the <B>Chooser</B>. The Chooseris where you choose the items that your Mac is connected to like printersand other computers. Once you have chosen the type of networking in theAppleTalk or Network control panel you can open the Chooser and you shouldsee the name of each computer that has been setup to share files on thenetwork by simply selecting the AppleShare icon on the left side. If youare trying to access printers you will want to choose the printer type thatyou have, for many Apple laser printers you will be selecting LaserWriter8.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/Chooser.gif" WIDTH="474" HEIGHT="201" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P><P><B>Where to go from here?</B></P><P>Once you have the connection between two or more computers up and runningthere are many things you can now do with your network.I personally usea network to <A HREF="http://www.retrospect.com/">back-up</A> importantdocuments from my laptop to my desktop machine. There is software that canallow you to <A HREF="http://www.vicomtech.com/surfdoubler/surf.main.html">sharemodems or internet connections</A> between multiple computers. One of thecooler things you can do is use software like <A HREF="http://www.netopia.com/software/tb2/mac/">Timbuktu</A>to control other computers on the network all from one machine.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <H4 ALIGN="CENTER">I hope I've helped you understand some of the fundamentals  of networking.
