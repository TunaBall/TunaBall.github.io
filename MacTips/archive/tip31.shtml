This MacTip is dedicated to the uniqueness of each Mac andsome sources from which you can gather information about your Mac.</P><P>Each Mac has its own uniqueness, sometimes that uniqueness is exhibitedin something cool, other times in things we might call issues or even bugs.Either way, knowing the specifics of your Mac can help you to be happierwith your Mac and be more effective in using it.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Model Number</H3><P>One aspect of uniqueness of each Macintosh is in the specific <B>modelnumber</B>. Although a discussion of Mac model numbers is a larger thanwill be discussed here, the model number of many Apple Macintoshes can tellyou what sort of case design, what technology it incorporates, and evensome of the extras that may have been included with it when it shipped.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Case Design</H3><P><B>Case design</B> is another aspect of uniqueness for individual Macs.Although there are very few Macs that have really special aspects abouttheir case like the signatures of the team that worked on the <A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/specsheets/Classic_Mac/Mac_Plus.html">MacPlus</A>molded to the inside of the case. Each Mac case has different capabilitiesand may be easier or harder to work on. Knowing the specifics of your Macscase can help you to take better advantage of your Mac.</P><P>Examples include, the ease of installation of additional hardware likememory or hard drives. The need for specific sized memory due to low clearanceof the memory slots. The availability of drive bays for install of morehard drives, CD drives or removable media like Zip drives. Even though twoMacs may use a similar case design, they may have different options availableto them. For instance, the <A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/datasheets/dt/pm7100-80.html">7100</A>,<A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/datasheets/dt/pm7500.html">7500</A>,and <A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/datasheets/dt/pmg3-series.html">DesktopG3</A> are seemingly similar same case design (at least from looking at the outside of the case) but the <A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/datasheets/dt/pm7100-80.html">7100</A>has no additional room for another hard drive, the <A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/datasheets/dt/pm7500.html">7500</A>has room for 1 additional and the <A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/datasheets/dt/pmg3-series.html">G3</A>can hold 2 addtional.</P><P>Other things that can be factors in case design is wether a particularcase can be upgraded to hold a newer logicboard like a <A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/specsheets/Centris_Quadra/Mac_Quadra_950.html">Quadra950</A> being upgraded to a <A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/datasheets/dt/pm9500-150.html">9500</A>.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Features</H3><P>Given that each Mac is designed with the curent technology there arecertain aspects that set each Mac apart.</P><P>One of these issues is types of memory and how best to install it. ManyMacs require you to install memory in pairs or even in sets of 4. Generallythis information is widley known do memory dealers and is communicated whenyou go to purchase memory. One aspect that often isn't widely communicatedis which Macs can take advantage of interleaving. Interleaving is the abilityto insert two memory modules and have your Mac address them as one. Interleavingcan result in a 10% or more gain in perofrmance. It isn't unusual for meto come across a machine that can support interleaving that has been setupwith matched memory modules but not in the appropriate slots. A simple moveof one memory module results in a free boost in performance.</P><P>Other functionalify that it can help to be aware of is the speed of yourinternal SCSI bus when <A HREF="tip28.shtml">upgrading a hard drive</A>.If you have a slower SCSI bus, you can use a slower less expensive drivewith no difference in performance. Likewise if you have a faster SCSI busyou can take advantage of a faster hard drive and see performance gains.</P><P>One cool but mostly useless functionality in one Mac is in the <A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/specsheets/Classic_Mac/Mac_Classic.html">MacClassic</A>. If you hold down the Command-Option-X-O keys when you turnthe computer on it will startup from ROM. This can allow you to startupyour <A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/specsheets/Classic_Mac/Mac_Classic.html">MacClassic</A> without a floppy or hard drive. The one thing I have used thisfeature for is to boot a Classic I found at a garage sale without the aidof any system software.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Technical Issues</H3><P>At the beginning of this MacTip we discussed all the work and decisionmaking that goes into each Macintosh model. Unfortunately the sum of allthat work and decision making doesn't always result in the perfect Macintosh.</P><P>For every Macintosh model you will be able to find people who insistthat a specific one is a lemon and another group who are equally confidentthat it is one of the best Macs ever made.</P><P>There are Macs that have had specific problems that have been addressedby Apple. Some publicly, some otherwise. Many of these issues can be foundin <A HREF="http://www.info.apple.com/til/">Apple's technical articles</A>,others can only be found through a little research. If you are having aspecific problem with a Mac that can't seem to be solved through the normaltrouble shooting of reinstalling the system etc. it might be worth searchingthe trouble shooting links below for any information about your particularMac.</P><P>It was information that was publicized in MacFixIt that told me my Macsfell within a certain range of serial numbers of ones that had a bad networkingchip. Unfortunately Apple didn't contact me to let me know I had one witha problem, so I had to track down the issue for myself. Upon calling on Apple,they were perfectly willing to replace the bad part. If you find your Machas one of these issues, it is worth calling Apple to see if there is aplan for getting your Mac fixed. Even if it is out of the standard warrantythere are often warranty extensions that can cover these known issues foryears after the standard warranty has expired.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Specific Software Updates</H3><P>One other aspect of uniqueness in individual Macs are the specific softwareupdates that may be required for specific machines. These usually come inthe form of specific small updates. These symptoms these updates deal withrange from small annoyances to serious issues.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P ALIGN=CENTER>I hope that the information above has helped you think  about your Mac as special. I'm sure you are wondering about how to find  this kind of information about your Mac.
