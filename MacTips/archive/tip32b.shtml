It is easy to tell how fragmentation can reduce the performanceof your Macintosh. Imagine that every time you open a particular file, insteadof having to simply go to one location on your hard drive it must go tomany different locations. And if the fragmented files happen to be a Systemfile like the Finder or a particular extension, every single thing you domay require jumping to many different physical locations on your hard drivejust to read information from one file. Imagine the difference between havingto load five different files that are each separated into 100 differentpieces scattered all over your hard drive and the same five files all linedup in single contiguous pieces right next to each other. The latter wouldcertainly require less work on the part of your hard drive and get the informationto your computer in a manner that would cause them to load as fast as possible.</P><P>One of the times when this situation may be most noticeable is when youare waiting for your computer to start up. This is particularly noticeableon slower Macintoshes. I've seen situations where starting from a fragmentedhard drive took a couple minutes of constant hard drive activity. Afteroptimization (the process of eliminating fragmentation) the computer wouldboot significantly faster with only minimal access to the hard drive. Notonly does this save time but is also kinder to your drive, not making itwork so hard for the information and thus making you it last longer.</P><P>A <A HREF="http://macspeedzone.netgate.net/Comparison/Fragmentation.html">reporton Mac Speed Zone</A> shows an example where a fragmented hard drive reducedperformance by more than 10% over a drive with no fragmentation.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Stability</B></P><P>Fragmentation can also play a part in the stability of your Mac. Althoughfragmentation is the cause of a very small percent of Macintosh troubleit can be to blame for various types of trouble with your hard drive. Thereason for these problems comes from your Mac having too much to keep trackof.</P><P>Imagine that before you could read the morning paper you had to go tohundreds of places to gather portions of each page and assemble them toform a complete paper. Really problems with fragmentation aren't much differentthan those that you would run into in the example of the morning newspaper.Sure if you only had a few pieces to put together you wouldn't have muchtrouble at all, but as the number of pieces increased and their size decreasedthe odds of loosing something or getting something in the wrong place isgreater. If even a small part of a file gets lost, that file may be a littleproblematic or if the file happens to be one that is essential for the operationof your computer it could keep your Mac from starting up with that terribleflashing question mark.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Ease of Error Recovery</B></P><P>Keeping fragmentation to a minimum not only can increase performanceand help with stability, it can be an advantage if you do run into trouble.Many times after a serious software corruption problem or if you do runinto a hardware problem the next question is going to be &quot;How can Iget my data back?&quot;. If you do find yourself in the unfortunate positionof needing to recover a hard drive, one with less fragmentation will generallybe easier to recover and have less effected files.</P><P>Generally when a hard drive goes bad it will only be a portion of thedrive that is effected. Think of it like a music CD (I was going to sayLP but I didn't want to have the burden of explaining what one was!) witha scratch on it. The only songs that would be unplayable are the ones thatare where the scratch was. Similarly on your hard drive, the only filesthat wouldn't be recoverable are the ones in the affected area. On a fragmenteddrive it is more likely that there will be more files that are in the badarea because there are more parts of each file spread over different partsof the hard drive. A drive with little fragmentation is more likely to havecomplete files unaffected by the problem area.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Areas of Excessive Fragmentation. </B></P><P>When thinking about fragmentation there are certain types of files thattend to easily become fragmented. Above we discussed a journal that is addedto every day. Files that are frequently added to or significantly editedare more susceptible to fragmentation. Files like this are usually eitherdatabases that a company will use for tracking information like customersor products. Probably one of the most common among internet users are thefiles that contain your email. Each and every time you download your email,you are adding information to the files on your hard drive similarly tothe journal we talked about earlier. Other files that are likely to getfragmented are ones that are automatically created or added to for you likelog files that track events like accesses to a web site.</P><P>Other trouble areas are where a specific application may write filesout to your hard drive and leave them there for a limited period of time.A classic example of this is the cache file for your web browser. Everygraphic or page of text you view over the internet is copied over the internetto your hard drive. These files are stored on your hard drive in case youneed to have access to them in the future (like if you hit the 'Back' button).As these items get out of date they are deleted to make room for more currentfiles. All this writing and deleting of files tends to, over time, increasefragmentation because the files that are being deleted leave empty spotsand the newer files don't always fit exactly into the spaces that are left.</P><P>Another area where fragmentation is apt to occur is when you are frequentlycopying files to and from your hard drive. If you are in a role where youreceive files from others and load them to your hard drive and then movethem to another place later you may be tangling yourself a twisted web offiles. This is even more true when receiving or downloading files over theinternet. Usually when you download a file from the internet it is bothcompressed and encoded to make it transfer faster and safely over the net.Once a file is downloaded it will converted to a un-encoded version andthen decompressed. So in effect, this single file you download will actuallybe three files (usually a HQX or BIN, then an SEA or SIT, and then the actualfile) before it is finished. Once again, all this converting and deletingof files over time can lead to increased fragmentation.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/SDfrags.gif" WIDTH="313" HEIGHT="247" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">One final thing that can cause fragmentation is oneof the least expected. Installing system updates can cause fragmentation.Especially if your hard drive is near capacity, it may be forced to installthe software of the update where ever it can find room. In looking at myDuo after installing Mac OS 8.1, the System file was fragmented into 147pieces. Given that every time I needed to access the system file, my computerwould need to piece together all 147 pieces. I'm sure there was a negativeimpact on performance. After defragmenting, the time it takes to startupthat Mac was reduced by 12 seconds.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Once you can identify the areas that are more likely to be fragmentedyou can see how important it is to make dealing with fragmentation a regularpart of your hard drive maintenance. <A HREF="tip32c.shtml">Now continueon to part 3 and see what to do about fragmentation.</A></P><P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></P><p align=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><a href="http://www.themacintoshguy.com/">The Macintosh Guy</a> || <a href="../">MacTips</a> || <a href="../../lists/">Email Lists</a> || <a href="http://roguelane.com/blog/">My Blog</a><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p><P ALIGN=CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></P><P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>This site, its source code, and the MacTips logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice.
