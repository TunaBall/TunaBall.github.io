The primarytool in stemming the effects of fragmentation is isolating files that havea tendency to become or cause fragmentation.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/driveicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/driveicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/driveicn.gif"WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/driveicn.gif"WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Partitioning isgenerally the best way to accomplish this. (<A HREF="tip10.shtml">MacTip10</A> and <A HREF="tip11.shtml">MacTip 11</A> discuss hard drive partitioning.)The hard drives of each of my Macs are broken into multiple volumes. I usuallybreak them into 4 parts. The first for the system files, the second forapplications and utilities, the third for documents I create, and the fourtha scratch for temporary files. This strategy allows your System folder tobe most isolated from possible fragmentation. A key part of this schemeis to use the &quot;Scratch&quot; partition for files that are frequentlymoved around. I use folders in this volume for the cache folders for myweb browser. Any files I get from the internet I download into that volumeand copy them to the appropriate place when it is finally in the form Iwant it in.</P><P>Another precaution in reducing the possibility of fragmentation is tobe sure to leave a bit (5 to 10 megabytes) of spare free on the drive. Justlike your cupboards, if you have a little extra space it is always easierto keep organized than if you are needing to use every last nook and cranny.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>What to do about Fragmentation.</B></P><P>Although fragmentation is a normal part of Mac OS computing, Apple providesno tools with which to deal with it.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/copy.gif" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="115" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The first option to deal with it manually. When filesare written to an empty drive they will be placed in complete pieces oneafter another with no fragmentation. If you have no tools with which todefragment your hard drive there is always the option to copy everythingoff your hard drive, erase it and copy everything back. Although this isn'tthe most elegant solution, it is an effective one.</P><P>The problem with the manual method is that you must have the abilityto completely remove everything from your hard drive. In most cases thisisn't practical.</P><P>Years ago software developers identified the need for a more elegantsolution and added drive optimization tools to their hard drive utilities.Over the years there have been a number of choices of optimization utilities.Unfortunately almost all of these were purchased by <A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/">Symantec</A>(Public Utilities, MacTools, etc.) and were discontinued. As of not toolong ago, the only solution available was Speed Disk, part of <A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/nu/fs_num.html">NortonUtilities</A> from <A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/">Symantec</A>. Morerecently there have been a couple tools that have been either announcedor released. At this point none of them include support Apple's new extendedformat, HFS+. But they all should be adding it soon.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/speedicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="LEFT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><B><A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/">Symantec's</A>Speed Disk</B>. Speed Disk (Part of <A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/">Symantec's</A><A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/nu/fs_num.html">Norton Utilities</A>) iscertainly the most popular disk optimization tool. Speed Disk does havea little bit of a bad reputation, I've certainly seen a number of machinesover the years that have been unbootable after having Speed Disk do itsthing. Although I've personally used Speed Disk hundreds of times with noincident. It is a good reminder to be sure to have a backup of your databefore doing any sort of maintenance on your drive. Speed Disk is certainlythe optimization tool with the most experience behind it.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/SDfrag.gif" WIDTH="523" HEIGHT="330" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/TTP2SS.JPG" ALIGN="RIGHT"><B><A HREF="http://www.micromat.com/">Micromat's</A><A HREF="http://www.micromat.com/micromat/TTP/TTP2/ttp2.html">TechTool Pro2</A></B>. <A HREF="http://www.micromat.com/">Micromat</A> recently releasedversion 2.0 TechTool. This version adds support for examining hard drivesand repairing problems. Micromat has promised to ship a disk optimizationtool shortly. (I've talked personally with Jeff at Micromat and he saysthey hope to have something out in June.) They will offer this as a freedownload when it is available. Personally I have more confidence in Micromat'sproducts than any other. They consistently offer updates that deal withnew issues in a speedy manner and communicate honestly about the capabilitiesand issues with their products.</P><P>MacTips will be giving away a copy of <A HREF="http://www.micromat.com/micromat/TTP/TTP2/ttp2.html">TechToolPro 2</A> to a member of the <A HREF="../../list.shtml">announcementlist</A> after an upcoming MacTip on Hard disk maintenance.

Constantlymonitoring the amount of fragmentation allows DiskExpress Pro to deal withfragmentation before it has a chance to cause problems. Although I haven'thad the opportunity to use it yet (I'll provide an update when I have) itsounds like an interesting solution for keeping hard drive fragmentationto a minnimum. <A HREF="http://www1.software.recallusa.com/software/">TotalRecall's</A> <A HREF="http://www2.software.recallusa.com/software/essentials.html">DiskEssentials</A>was formerly bundled with a previous version of DiskExpress but will nolonger be in the latest update.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Note:</FONT></B> None of the above optimizationutilities are curently compatible with HFS+, be sure to make sure you havea compatible version before running any of these on a volume formatted withApple's extended disk format.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Precautions</B></P><P>Regardless of the tool you choose there are a couple things to keep inmind prior to optimizing (defragmenting) your hard drive.</P><P>When you optimize a hard drive are moving each file from a state of beingin multiple pieces on various parts of the drive to one contiguous block.This usually involves moving each piece of data two or more times beforeit gets to the appropriate location on your drive. All this moving arounddoes come at a small risk. Your best bet is to make sure that you have abackup of anything that you don't want to loose. Odds are everything willbe fine but if you happen to run into trouble it is always better to knowthat you've got a backup.</P><P>Even a small problem on your hard drive an become a big one if you tryto optimize your drive without fixing the problem first. Always be sureto run a hard drive diagnostic tool (like <A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/nu/fs_num.html">NortonUtilities</A>, <A HREF="http://www.micromat.com/micromat/TTP/TTP2/ttp2.html">TechToolPro 2</A>, or <A HREF="http://www2.software.recallusa.com/software/essentials.html">DiskEssentials</A>)before attempting to optimize your hard drive. Most optimization tools providesome level of drive inspection before proceeding with the optimization butit is always safest to do it yourself prior to using them.</P><P>The other thing to keep in mind that software is developed by peopleand there is no such thing as bug-free software. Whatever tool you use mayhave an update available. Be sure that you are using the latest version.The other thing that can necessitate an update is if Apple comes out witha new version of the Mac OS. If you've updated your system software to themost recent version, be sure to check with the developer of your utilityto make sure that it is compatible with the system version you have installed.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Final Thoughts</B></P><P>Although fragmentation is a part of the normal operation of your Mac,keeping it in its place can help your Mac stay at peak performance and helpprovide a little more stability. I hope this MacTip has helped you understandfragmentation a bit more and given you some information that will enhanceyour Mac OS experience.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <H4 ALIGN=CENTER>I hope this MacTip has helped you understand fragmentation  and will be of assistance in dealing with it in the future.</H4>  <H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>Eric Prentice</H4></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=CENTER>Don't forget to join the <A HREF="../../list.shtml">announcementlist</A> to be notified when each new MacTip is posted.</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Bottom navbar.lbi" --><HRSIZE="4"><p align=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><a href="http://www.themacintoshguy.com/">The Macintosh Guy</a> || <a href="../">MacTips</a> || <a href="../../lists/">Email Lists</a> || <a href="http://roguelane.com/blog/">My Blog</a><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p><HR SIZE="4"><P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>This site, its source code, and the MacTips logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice.
