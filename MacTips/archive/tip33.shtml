Although just as important as the speed of the CPU it is often rarelymentioned when purchasing a new Mac.</P><P>Simply put, <B>Bus Speed </B>is the rate at which the different componentsof your computer communicate.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>A Bus Defined.</B></P><P>A bus, in computing terms is simply a path for data or information. Thereare a number of busses at work in your computer. The Apple Desktop Bus (ADB)handles information that is transmitted to and from your keyboard and mouse.The SCSI bus manages hard drives, CD-ROMs, scanners, etc. The PCI bus handlesinformation that passes through and PCI cards that might be installed. Allof these busses and others communicate with the <B>system bus</B> whichis the topic of this MacTip.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>The System Bus</B></P><P>The system bus is the path that all this information takes as it makesits way through the various parts of your logic board. Some of the itemson this system bus are; SCSI controllers for reading information from harddrives, CD-ROM drives, scanners, etc.; network cards for communication overa network; video cards for showing information on your monitor; serial portcontrollers for communicating with local printers or modems; chips for communicatingwith your keyboard and mouse; and others. Although each of these items communicateswith external devices at their own speed and in their own way, all the informationis brought to the system bus which carries it to different parts of thelogic board.</P><P>Each and every bit of information your computer deals with travels throughvarious parts of the logic board. A typical path for information might beto be read it off the hard drive, it then gets loaded into memory, it thentravels to the CPU where it gets manipulated, and then out to the videoport to the monitor so you can see the result. Each and every part of yourcomputer handles some portion of the information that allows you computerto operate.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Why?</B></P><P>The simple fact that it is the responsibility of the system bus to handleevery bit of information your computer deals with, the speed at which itoperates can be a significant factor in performance.</P><P>Many times when we are looking at purchasing a computer the only factorwe see advertised is the speed (megahertz) of the processor. Although processorspeed is a significant factor in performance there are many other factorsinvolved. Bus speed is just one of those factors. Current bus speeds generallyrun between 33 and 66 mhz. The original Macs ran at a bus speed of 8 mhz.Only the latest Macs run at 66 mhz and some of the new and yet to be releasedMacs have been pushed up to 83 mhz.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>A Little History of System Bus Speeds</B></P><P>In the very first Macs the processor speed was directly linked to thesystem bus speed. So if you have a Mac SE, both the bus and the processorare running at a speed of 8 mhz.</P><P>With the advent of the Quad Macs (those with Motorola's 68040 processor)there was a difference between the internal speed of the processor and thatof the system bus. For example, the Quadra 650 had a system bus speed ofonly 33 mhz but the processor ran at 66 mhz internally. (Some people debatethat this was only a marketing move but these chips were indeed doubledwithin the processor.) This allowed small bits of information to be handledby the processor at a higher speed before they were passed on to the othercomponents of the computer.</P><P>The original PowerMacs built upon this principle by not only having theprocessors run at a rate twice the speed of the system bus but also includeda small portion of memory (32k) to which the processor had fast access.This allowed the processor to work with this data at the faster processorspeed instead of having to write it out over the system bus to the installedmemory.</P><P>The original PowerMac the 6100 ran with a processor speed of 60 mhz.This was accomplished through doubling the system bus speed of 30 mhz. Asthe upgrades for these machines came along Apple bumped the system bus speedto 33 mhz, thus allowing the processor to operate at 66 mhz. The next machinesto be released were those in the 7100 line. The 7100s raised the systembus speed to 40 mhz and the processor double that to 80 mhz. As technologygot better and cheaper processors were developed to operate at even higherspeeds. When Apple released the 8100 line they included a 110 mhz processor.Although the processor was considerably faster, that speed was coupled witha 36.7 mhz system bus. So the 8100/110 had a processor that was about 40%faster than the 7100/80 but the speed of the logic board was about 8% slower.Although the processor may be able to churn through information faster,the rate at which that information is transferred between memory, storagedevices, and the screen.</P><P>As Macs have gotten faster and faster over the past few years the disparitybetween processor speed and system bus speed has increased. Current PowerMacshave system bus speeds of 50-66 mhz. This is only about twice that of Macsreleased more than 5 years ago. This means that even the most powerful Macshave processors that are running 4.5 (G3/300) to 7 times (9600/350) thatof the logic board bus speed.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>So what does this all mean?</B></P><P>The key thing to understand about system bus speeds is that it determinesthe time it takes for information to make it around to the different componentsof your computer. The limited bus speed means different things for kindsof users. Operations which are processor dependent (like calculating spreadsheets) will see performance boosts hand in hand with higher processor speeds.Other operations which are more ram and bus dependent (like rendering 3Dimages or video) will benefit less from the higher processor speed whenthe bus speed remains the same. A good example where the system bus becomesthe <B>bottleneck</B> is in the new G3 series. The time it takes a 233 mhzPowerMac G3 to move information between the processor and ram is the sameas the 300 mhz PowerMac G3.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Stretching the neck of the bottle with a backside cache.</B></P><P>Of course the limitations of bus speed are no stranger to Apple. Onesignificant step in stretching the neck of the bottle has been the implementationof what is called a 'backside cache'.</P><P>A backside cache is a portion of memory that is allowed to communicatewith the processor at a speed higher than that of the system bus. That way,information can be passed between this faster memory and the processor withouthaving to be handled by the slower system bus. Typically backside cachesrun at about 50% that of the processor although you can purchase third partyprocessor upgrades that include a 1 megabyte caches that communicates withthe processor at 100% of the processor speed.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Processor upgrades.</B></P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/upcard.gif" WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="68" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">If you have a more recent PowerMac it is more than likelythat your processor is on an daughter card that can be upgraded. If thisis the case the bus speed of your Mac is dictated by the speed of the processorcard that is installed. When upgrading, it is important to consider boththe speed of the processor on the card and the speed at which your systembus will operate with it.installed. The maximum performance can be achievedfrom the upgrade with will maximize both. Although processor speed willalways remain the most important factor in performance, an upgrade whichdecreases the bus speed may leave some of the potential of your Mac untapped.Below are some of the combinations of processor speed and bus speed availablefor some Macs. As you can see, the 100 mhz, 150 mhz and 200 mhz optionsmaximize both processor speed and bus speed to provide the optimal performancefor the dollar in considering an upgrade.</P><UL>  <P><TABLE WIDTH="70%" BORDER="1" HEIGHT="174" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING=  "0"><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Processor Speed</B></TD><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Bus Speed</B></TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>100 MHz</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>50.0 MHz</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>120 MHz</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>40.0 MHz</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>132 MHz</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>44.0 MHz</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>150 MHz</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>50.0 MHz</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>166 MHz</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>48.0 MHz</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>180 MHz</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>45.0 MHz</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>200 MHz</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>50.0 MHz</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>233 MHz</TD><TD WIDTH="50%">  <P ALIGN=CENTER>46.6 MHz</TD></TR></TABLE></UL><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Final words.</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Although the speed of your system bus won't make a difference in how  you use your computer day by day, understanding how it works and the role  it plays in the performance of your Mac can help you be more intelligent  in upgrading your current Mac or in choosing a new one.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Some related links.</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><A HREF="http://www.newertech.com/software/guru.html"><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Guru  lists the bus speed of each Mac and other useful information.</FONT></B></A></P>  <P><A HREF="http://www.mackido.com/Dojo/bussed.html"><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Takin'  the Bus</FONT></B></A></P>  <P><A HREF="http://www.powerlogix.com/bus.html"><B><FONT SIZE=-1>The Final  Word on Bus Speed, Clock Speed, and Cache</FONT></B></A></P>  <P><A HREF="http://macspeedzone.com/4.0/LinksBenchmarking.html"><B><FONT   SIZE=-1>Other Benchmarking Links</FONT></B></A></P>  <P><A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/macuser/mu_0397/news/news02.html"><B><FONT   SIZE=-1>The Perils of Radio Activity</FONT></B></A></P>  <P><A HREF="http://til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/14b806f5b63e5c3386256495005accbb/ac52d5fe1b678d5b862564b40000d12f?OpenDocument"><B><FONT   SIZE=-1>Processor Upgrades: Effect On Bus Speed (6/97)</FONT></B></A></P>  <P><A HREF="http://til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/14b806f5b63e5c3386256495005accbb/5abc3eef6108b2168525651500340f35?OpenDocument"><B><FONT   SIZE=-1>Power Macintosh: Bus Speeds (9/97)</FONT></B></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><HR SIZE="4"><p align=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><a href="http://www.themacintoshguy.com/">The Macintosh Guy</a> || <a href="../">MacTips</a> || <a href="../../lists/">Email Lists</a> || <a href="http://roguelane.com/blog/">My Blog</a><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p><HR SIZE="4"><P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>This site, its source code, and the MacTips logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice.
