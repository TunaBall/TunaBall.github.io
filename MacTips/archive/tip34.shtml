Nor will you find a detailed description of PRAM settings, DesktopDatabases, Volume Information Blocks, Volume Bit Maps, or the extents tree.</P><P>What you will find is a reasonable guide to maintaining your Mac thatshould help you elude the more serious problems that can plague your Mac.Most every area of Macintosh maintenance has been covered by a previousMacTip. You will find links to each one under the specific topic.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>What to do?</H3><P>Maintaining your Mac should be more than simply running a disk utilityor rebuilding the desktop when you have an unexplained crash or somethinggoes wrong. Mac maintenance should be a planned set of actions geared towardseliminating potential issues before they become problems.</P><H3>How often? (an ounce of prevention?)</H3><P><IMG SRC="../../images/datentime.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The most significant factor in maintaining your Macis simply doing it. Just like most problems, a little forethought can keepa small problem from becoming a big one. The first thing to consider iswhat sort of schedule you need to follow. Generally, once a month is a goodplace to start. If you use your Mac for things that are highly criticalmore often may be reasonable. If you only use your Mac for entertainmentor for writing an occasional letter, every couple months may be sufficientfor periodical maintenance.</P><H3>Backup</H3><P><IMG SRC="../../images/bbeditfile.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/quickendoc.gif" WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/exceldoc.gif"WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The primary goalof any sort of maintenance is to keep whatever you are maintaining functioningproperly. Although maintenance is your best bet on keeping your Mac a secureplace for your information and projects there will always be the chanceof major unforeseen problems or an accidental deletion of files. At itssimplest, a backup is just another copy of your files that you can returnto if there happened to be a problem with the original. Although we won'tdiscuss backups in depth here, a future MacTip will discuss all the insan outs of backups.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/bbeditfile.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/quickendoc.gif" WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/exceldoc.gif"WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Really there aretwo options when thinking about backups. The first is to keep a backup ofabsolutely everything on your hard drive. Although this is the only wayto make sure that you will have anything you might need in case there isa serious problem, you will need a considerable amount of storage spaceand some sort of backup utility to keep you from having to backup the yourentire system when only a few items may have changed. The second optionis to only backup the specific data files that would be most difficult orimpossible to replace. Examples of these files might include your emaildatabase, your Quicken data file, contact lists, browser bookmark files,specific preferences, etc. Choosing only a few files to back up can be aseasy as dragging them to a plain old floppy to make a copy. Just backingup the few essential files might provide enough security to help you sleepbetter at night you do run the risk of forgetting a certain file you mightlater realize you needed. If for some reason your drive did suffer somecatastrophic problem, you would need to reinstall your system and all youapplications from scratch. Although just backing up specific files wouldprovide the security of not having to recreate those files, you aren't protectingall the time and energy you have put into installing and configuring yourMacintosh. A future MacTip will discuss backup on the Mac.</P><P>Regardless of the approach you take, doing some sort of backup is anessential part of maintaining your Mac. Just do it! You'll be glad you did.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Organization and Cleaning</H3><P><IMG SRC="../../images/screen.jpg" WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="119" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The first thing to think about is organization and cleaning.When taking your periodical look at your Mac, the best place to start isto take a quick run through your hard drive and put files in their properplace. Deleting unneeded files, putting stray files in their place and emptyingthe trash is a great place to start. If you are anything like me, aftera month you end up with quite a pile of file on the desktop and elsewhere.Especially those who download all the latest updates and utilities fromthe internet will receive great benefit from occasional filing and removalof the files that build up. This may also be a good time to clean out yourWeb browser's cache folder (usually found in the 'Preferences' folder inthe 'System Folder'). Manually cleaning it out can head off problems thatcan get in the way of your web browser operating properly. Other items thatmight also be included in this section is deleting old email, cleaning upyour contact databases, or organizing your web browser's bookmark file.</P><P>This is also a good time to consider organizing your computer workspacetoo. Personally I have a much easier time keeping my virtual desktop organizedthan my physical desktop.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Disk Integrity</H3><P><IMG SRC="../../images/driveicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/dfaicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="25"ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The next thing to do is to run some sortof disk utility to verify the integrity of your hard drive and the filesit contains. The first and best disk utility is the one that comes withevery Mac, Disk First Aid. Although Disk First Aid won't find the smallerless critical issues with your hard drive, where the commercial disk utilitieslook for things that are less than perfect, Disk First Aid will only reportissues that would be currently causing you trouble. Disk First Aid has anextremely low incidence of problems. You can almost always be sure thatrunning the current version will be a good thing for your Mac.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <BLOCKQUOTE>    <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Unfortunately, not all disk utilities are foolproof (or    even NERDproof). I've encountered a number of situations where allowing    a disk utility to fix some serious problems has rendered a hard drive completely    unreadable. The one thing that has seemed to keep these serious side effects    is to allow Disk First Aid to fix any problems it finds before using Norton    Disk Doctor, or another disk utility to do its repairs. The combination    of Disk First Aid and a commercial disk utility seems to be the best way    to tackle serious problems. Following this course has significantly decreased    the incidence of data loss while performing disk maintenance.</P>    <P>There is no shortage of pitfalls that you can fall into while using    disk utilities, MacTip #35 will discuss disk utilities more specifically    and help you to use them wisely to minimize possible complications. Of    course, a recent backup is always the best way to ke our files secure.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>  </BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><P><IMG SRC="../../images/ttp2logo.jpeg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="85"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Although Disk First Aid is a great tool for findingissues with your hard drive that might be causing you trouble it doesn'tdo a number of things. It doesn't check the physical integrity of your harddrive, it is unable to fix some more serious problems, and it doesn't checkeach file individually for problems. <IMG SRC="../../images/nortdr.gif" WIDTH="61" HEIGHT="62" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The other third partydisk utilities on the market do a much more thorough job of verifying allthe data on your hard drive. These disk utilities look for anything thatis less then perfect, that might cause you trouble sometime in the future.Although you can't repair serious problems on a drive that has files orprograms in use or one that contains the active system folder, you can runyour disk utility on the drive and then start from another disk (anotherhard drive, CD or floppy) only if you need to repair some serious issues.Apple has announced that they will allow Disk First Aid to be run on theactive System folder in Mac OS 8.5. It is possible that other utility developerswill follow suit once 8.5 is released.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/nortonreport.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">If while using a disk utility you do fix some seriousproblems, it is a good idea to let that utility take another pass at checkingthat drive. It isn't unusual for serious problems to take a couple of timesof clicking the 'Fix' button to get the problem really solved. It is alsoa good idea to keep track of any serious problems found and fixed whileusing disk utilities. If you begin to notice that you are having the sameproblems over and over you might want to look into it deeper.</P><P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE=-1>Note: Keep in mind that many disk utilitieswill need an update to work on disks using Apple's new HFS+. Using an outof date version of a disk utility may cause damage to your data.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Rebuild the Desktop Database</H3><P><IMG SRC="../../images/genaricdoc.gif" WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/rebuild.gif" WIDTH="187" HEIGHT="52" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Another item that fits well intoperiodical maintenance is rebuilding the desktop database files. These fileskeep track of which files are associated with which programs and also providesthe icons that help you identify what program a particular file belongsto. Holding down the Command and Option keys (the two next to the spacebar on desktop Macs) when your Mac starts up will provide you with the opportunityto rebuild the desktop. MacTip #5 &quot;<A HREF="tip5.shtml">The DesktopDatabase and Invisible files</A>&quot;. discusses the ins and outs of thedesktop database. Rebuilding the desktop will ensure that all of your programsand files show the right icons and will make sure that the appropriate applicationis opened when you double click a file on your hard drive.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>PRAM</H3><P>Another item that often is included in Macintosh maintenance is <B>zappingthe PRAM</B>. PRAM is a small area of memory in your Mac that holds thingslike monitor settings, network settings, your highlight color, etc. Zappingyour PRAM is simply the process of forcing your Mac to purge all the settingsit contains and load the default set. Although there is the remote possibilitythat periodically zapping your PRAM might keep a small problem from becominga bigger one, there is rarely a reason to give your PRAM a zap unless itis in the context of trouble shooting a specific issue. If you happen tobe in this habit and are pleased with the way your Mac runs then great.If this is the first time you have heard of PRAM or you aren't in the habitof zapping it, there isn't a good reason to start. In a study one companydid on which trouble shooting techniques worked more of the time, zappingthe PRAM was of assistance only a small fraction of the time. MacTip #17&quot;<A HREF="tip17.shtml">PRAM and the Battery</A>&quot; discusses therole of PRAM in the operation of your Mac.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Disk Optimization</H3><P>In normal use of your Mac files are segmented into multiple physicalpieces on your hard drive. MacTip #32 &quot;<A HREF="tip32.shtml">Fragmentation</A>&quot;discusses this segmenting of files called <B>fragmentation</B>. Althoughthis is normal, and the way your Mac was designed to function, fragmentationcan lead to problems over time if it isn't kept at bay. Eliminating filefragmentation (or optimization) is an important part of periodical harddrive maintenance. If everything is functioning properly the most seriousproblem caused by fragmentation will be poor performance. Fragmentationtaken to extremes can lead to corruption of files and lost data. A drivewith little fragmentation is also much easier to repair or recover if problemsdo occur than one with more severe fragmentation.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Once you've backed up, cleaned up, checked out, rebuilt, and optimizedyour Mac you can rest in the fact that you've done just about everythingpossible to protect the investment you've made in setting up your Mac andthe time and energy contained within each one of your files. Following theguidelines above will allow your Mac to perform years of service with thosenagging crashes farther apart and more time with your Mac smiling at youand you smiling at your Mac.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Really Mac maintenance is a matter of choices. <B>Pay now, or pay later.  </B>Unfortunately no one has designed a computer operating system that  can operate indefinitely at optimal performance with out outside interaction.  We often look at spending money for specific upgrades to increase the performance  of our computers. Making the decision to spend a little time to perform  periodical maintenance can be the best thing you can do to keep your Mac  operating at peak performance and also be prepared for any unforeseen problems  that might come your way.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><AHREF="../index.html" TARGET="">MacTips</A> || <A HREF="../contact.shtml"TARGET="">Feedback</A> || <A HREF="../archive.shtml" TARGET="">MacTips Archive</A>|| <A HREF="http://www.themacintoshguy.com">The Macintosh Guy</A> <!-- #EndLibraryItem --></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></P><P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>This site, its source code, and the MacTips logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice.
