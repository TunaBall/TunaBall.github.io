Evenworse seeing that <A HREF="http://til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/f22d63e8645ef6d586256495005bd168/653fc912b618e682052565c500522074?OpenDocument">flashingquestion mark</A> and wondering if behind it lies an empty wasteland thatwas once your hard drive full of data. If data corruption is a predatorlurking in the darkness waiting for an opening to steal your most preciousfiles, disk utilities are our knights in shining armor waiting our beaconcall to guarantee the security of our data.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/dfaicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" vspace="2" hspace="2"><IMG SRC="../../images/NDDicn.gif"WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="2" hspace="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><B><IMG SRC="../../images/TTP2icn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT"hspace="2" vspace="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></B>This MacTip discusses Macintoshdisk utilities, how to use them and how to avoid some of the trouble youcan get into using them.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>What they do.</H3><P><IMG SRC="../../images/driveicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="RIGHT"vspace="2" hspace="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">All disk utilities function onthe same premise. There are two conditions it concerns itself with, whatyour drive looks like, and what a healthy drive looks like. A healthy drivehas certain factors that are true when it is operating properly.</P><P>Each disk on your machine regardless of size will always have specificelements that make it function properly. At the beginning of each disk willbe information that tells your computer how to make it show up on the desktopof your machine. There will also be information containing the name of thedisk, in what format the data is stored, the location and size of the fileson the disk, etc. Likewise, each file is also stored in a standard formatthat includes information about the file itself.</P><P>Any of this standard information getting lost or damaged can result infiles becoming damaged or unusable or at worst, your while disk becomingunreadable.</P><P>Disk utilities comb through your drive and look for information thatdoesn't fit into its view of the way healthy information looks.</P><P>When a disk utility finds problem, it is simply reporting that thereis a portion of the disk that doesn't fit within what that particular versionof the utility thinks it should look like.</P><P>Clicking the 'Fix' button is simply telling the disk utility to do whatit can to make your hard drive look like what it thinks a good one shouldlook like.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>How to use Disk Utilities.</H3><P>Disk utilities generally look for three kinds of problems, <B>superficial</B>,<B>serious</B>, and <B>hardware</B>.</P><P><B>Superficial problems</B> are those that will generally not have anyimpact of the usability or stability of your Mac. Items such as these are&quot;icon bundle bits&quot; which handle the showing of icons or &quot;Baddates&quot; which are simply files that have dates associated with themthat are either in the future or are so far in the past that they couldn'tbe accurate. (None of your files were created before about 15 years agomost likely.) These superficial problems aren't really worth worrying aboutand don't have any impact besides the cosmetic view of the icons in theFinder or the dates you see when you look at the file information of anaffected file.</P><P>Superficial problems can usually be fixed at any time and should notrequire any special setup or booting from a repair floppy or system CD todeal with these problems.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Serious problems</B> are ones that fall within the category of onesthat put your data at risk. Problems such as these usually start out smalland harmless but left unchecked can lead to corrupted data, lost files,system crashes or even losing everything on your hard drive. Problems suchas these will show up as issues with the volume bit map, volume informationblocks, catalog b-tree, damaged data or resource forks, and others. Theseserious problems can effect either individual files and applications orthe basic file structure of your hard drive. Symptoms of these more seriousproblems can include more frequent system or application crashes, filesor applications refusing to open, etc. Some of these problems that effectthe basic structure of your hard drive can show themselves other ways too.If files disappear from the Finder, you can't get a particular disk to mounton the desktop, or even if you begin seeing more than one copy of filesin a folder you may have some of these more serious disk structure problems.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/dfaicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" vspace="2" hspace="2"><B>Always run Disk First Aid first.</B>One little trick that I have always used has been to run Apple's <A HREF="http://swupdates.info.apple.com/cgi-bin/lister.pl?Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/US/Macintosh/Utilities/Disk_First_Aid/">DiskFirst Aid</A> before using one of the commercial disk utilities. The problemsDisk First Aid can find and repair have been significantly improved in recentyears and the safety of the repairs it performs is rarely questioned. UnfortunatelyI've had a number of customers who have lost data through using some ofthe commercial disk utilities to repair their drives. I've never had situationswhere I've lost data when allowing Disk First Aid to perform the repairsit could before using another disk utility.</P><P>Disk First Aid is really good at finding issues with your hard drivethat would be causing you problems. The commercial disk utilities take inspectiona level deeper and look for anything that is less than perfect.</P><P>Although some serious disk problems can be fixed while your are startedup from your hard drive, it is better to start from another hard drive,your system CD, or the disk or CD that came with your disk utility beforeattempting to repair any problems. In the same way that a doctor might beable to put a band aid on his own minor injury he would never consider performingany major sort of surgery on himself, it is the same with doing repairson your hard drive. It is always a good idea not to have any other applicationsrunning and to boot with your system extensions off (holding the Shift keydown when you start your Mac) when fixing serious problems. If you are justlooking to see if you have problems it is OK to perform the checking operationsof disk utilities while booted from your hard drive. If problems are foundyou can then deal with booting from another disk.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Hardware problems </B>are different than the serious problems mentionedabove in the fact that they are caused by physical problems with your harddrive itself. Although these problems may exhibit themselves in some ofthe same ways as above they generally require more serious action to remedythe situation than simply clicking a &quot;Fix&quot; button. The most commonkind of hardware problem is a bad block. Bad blocks are areas of your harddrives surface that wear out and can no longer store information. In mostcases reformatting your hard drive is the only way to mark off those badspots so your computer won't use them in the future. More serious hardwareproblems can necessitate the replacement of your hard drive.</P><P>The most complete way to deal with possible hardware issues with yourhard drive is to do a complete format. Formatting completely removes allthe data from the drive so it is essential to have a current backup if youhave information that you don't want to lose.</P><P>Reformatting a hard drive can both be a good way to fix minor hardwareproblems such as bad blocks and also a good way to test a hard drive tomake sure there aren't more serious hardware problems.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/DSU.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" vspace="2" hspace="2">Personally I recommend using Apple's Drive Setupwhenever possible because it is the most compatible and tested. Drive setup'sstandard initialization really just takes a quick run over your drive andreestablishes the basic directory structure. Two 'Initialization Options'(from under the 'Functions' menu) can both ensure that any bad blocks willbe sectioned off and that the drive is ready to hold data. Selecting a 'Lowlevel format' will actually send a command to your hard drive that willtake it through somewhat of a self diagnostic that will block out any badblocks by examining each part of the drive bit by bit. <IMG SRC="../../images/initopt.gif"WIDTH="302" HEIGHT="201" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="5" hspace="5" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Choosing to 'Zero all data' will follow the low level format with theprocess of writing empty information to each part of the drive that couldstore information. The combination of these two initialization options isone of the best tests for the integrity of your hard drive. If you are ableto complete these successfully you can be reasonably assured that your harddrive is in good condition. On the other hand, if you are unable to completethese operations successfully, odds are you will need to consider havingyour Mac serviced and most likely need to replace your hard drive altogether.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Recurrent Problems</H3><P>Any time you are use your disk utility to <B>fix serious problems</B>it is a good idea to <B>run the same disk utility again</B> to make surethat the problems are indeed fixed and that there aren't possibly otherproblems that were uncovered in the process of fixing the first ones.</P><P>One of the more frustrating situations when using disk utilities is whenthe same <B>problems come up over and over again</B>. Although the currentdisk utilities on the market do a good job of getting out of some toughsituations they are not perfect. Depending on the problems specific to yourhard drive it is possible that the same problems can either keep happeningor that the problems are so serious that the disk utilities are unable tosufficiently fix them. If you have a similar problem that only recurs overthe course of a few months you shouldn't be really concerned. If the sameproblems come back right away or after only a few days you may have a moreserious problem.</P><P>Regardless of the cause you may come up against a problem that your chosendisk utility can't crack. In a number of discussions with different techsupport agents about these type of situations we've always ended up at thesame place, basically nowhere. These cases your only course of action isto completely backup your hard drive and reformat it as mentioned above.It is ideal to use a backup utility to backup your information because mostbackup utilities include some verification of the integrity of your datathus increasing the likelihood that you won't have more problems in thefuture.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/datentime.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">There is one type of recurring problem that does havea simple solution. If your <B>recurring problem</B> happens to involve<B>bad dates </B>you should make sure that your date and time are set correctlyon your Mac. If your Mac is set to a date that your disk utility will recognizeas a bad date (like sometime in 1904 for example) it will replace bad dateswith bad dates. This isn't a serious problem but I've certainly talked witha number of people who have been puzzled by this predicament.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H2>Precautions:</H2><P><B>Always perform a proper shut down.</B></P><P>One of the major causes of problems on Mac Hard drives is not shuttingdown your computer properly. The only safe way to turn off your computeris to use one of the standard methods for shutting down. (Either choosing'Shut Down' from the 'Special' menu or holding the power button on yourkeyboard and clicking the 'Shut Down' button.)</P><P>Performing a proper shut down ensures that all files are properly closedand the any information that was being stored in memory has been writtento the hard drive.</P><P>Improper shutdowns include simply hitting the power button on the frontor back of your machine, yanking the power cord out of the wall, turningoff your surge protector, and crashing. Any of these can leave files inan incomplete state which can lead to disk problems. This is enough of aproblem that Mac OS 8.5 will automatically run Disk First Aid when startingyour Mac after an Improper shutdown.</P><H2>&nbsp;</H2><P><B>Backup! Backup! Backup!</B></P><P>Backups are an essential part of any disk maintenance. Fixing seriousproblems on your hard drive is like any medical operation. Even though mostrepairs are simple and routine there is always the risk of a small problembecoming a big one and attempting to deal with a seemingly benign symptomcould reveal a serious problem that has as of yet gone unnoticed. Also someproblems are serious enough that attempting to deal with them at all willresult in data being lost. That said, your only security can be frequentand complete backups.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>No harm in checking, just fixing.</B></P><P>Generally there is no risk in using a disk utility to check your harddrive. If you have reason to suspect there might be some problems with yourhard drive it doesn't hurt to fire up your disk utility and check out yourdrive. If everything comes out fine you don't need to worry about doinganything further. If you do find problems then you can take the next stepto startup off your disk utility repair disk and deal with any problemsthat are found.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>System version and disk format.</B></P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/findericn.gif" WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="RIGHT"vspace="2" hspace="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><IMG SRC="../../images/sysicn.gif"WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="2" hspace="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">The single biggest issue in using disk utilities goes back to our initialdiscussion about how disk utilities work. Disk utilities are designed tocompare your drive to what it thinks it should look like. Unfortunatelyif the view of a good drive that is stored within your disk utility is outdatedit can see a perfectly good hard drive as damaged. Before using any diskutility it is essential that you make sure the disk utility you have iscompatible with whatever version of the Mac OS you are running on your Mac.Similarly, if you are using Apple's new extended disk format (HFS+) youwill want to make sure that the disk utility you are using is compatiblewith it too.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Did I Mention backups?</B></P><P>Spending just a few minutes to backup your essential data can save hoursof work recreating your documents.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Hard Drive Formatting Software.</B></P><P>In addition to making sure that your disk utility is compatible withyour version of the Mac OS and disk format you also want to make sure thatyou are using the latest version of whatever <B>disk formatting utility</B>you use.</P><P>Personally I believe <B>it is safest to use Apple's Drive Setup</B> forformatting your hard drives. Drive setup is the most used and tested formattingutility. Outdated or non-Apple formatting tools have been the cause of someproblems with disk utilities in the past.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Partitioning</B></P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/driveicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="RIGHT"vspace="2" hspace="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><IMG SRC="../../images/driveicn.gif"WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="2" hspace="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><IMG SRC="../../images/driveicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="RIGHT"vspace="2" hspace="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Partitioning can be a good securitymeasure to help protect your data. Dividing your hard drive into separatepartitions can help keep problems that occur on one partition from causingtrouble on other partitions. Check out <B>MacTip #10 </B><A HREF="tip10.shtml">HardDrive Partitioning, Part(ition) 1</A> and <B>MacTip #11 </B><A HREF="tip11.shtml">HardDrive Partitioning, Part(ition) 2</A> which discuss some of the benefitsof partitioning.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>When to use a Disk Utility?</H3><P>The final thing to consider when looking at disk utilities is when touse them. Ideally disk utilities will be used before you experience symptomsfrom some of the minor problems that can crop up. It is best to put yourselfon a schedule where you run your disk utility on a monthly basis.</P><P>If you aren't able to perform maintenance on a regular basis you mightwant some warning signs to look for that might clue you into the presenceof a problem with your disk drive. Clues include unexplained crashing, Finderanomalies like duplicate files, disappearing icons, or unreadable corruptedfiles.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Related Links:</H3><P><A HREF="http://www.micromat.com/">MicroMat's TechTool Pro 2</A></P><P><A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/">Symantec's Norton Utilities</A></P><P><A HREF="http://www.software.recallusa.com/softwarenews.html">RecallUSA's Disk Essentials</A></P><P>&nbsp;</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>I hope this MacTip has helped you understand disk utilities a bit better  and will help you avoid some of the problems that can cause trouble.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><AHREF="../index.html" TARGET="">MacTips</A> || <A HREF="../contact.shtml"TARGET="">Feedback</A> || <A HREF="../archive.shtml" TARGET="">MacTips Archive</A>|| <A HREF="http://www.themacintoshguy.com">The Macintosh Guy</A> <!-- #EndLibraryItem --></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></P><P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>This site, its source code, and the MacTips logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice.
