Without Iconsa Mac wouldn't be a Mac. This MacTip examines system icons, applicationicons, custom icons and some icon sites. Icons are one of the coolest andmost elegant parts of the Mac OS. Much of this MacTip may be review formore seasoned Mac users but with more and more new Mac users we can't forgetthe basic things that make the Mac shine.</P><P>MacTip #36 is the first in a short series of Icon related MacTips. MacTip#37 will be dedicated to icon tools and members of the MacTip announcementlist will also have the opportunity to win a number of the cooler icon utilities.Ifthere is a specific icon utility that you have found usefull I would loveto hear about it.</P><P>Icons serve a number of purposes on the Mac. They provide informationabout what kind of file they represents, the program that created them,the type of file, whether a file is selected, etc. Without icons many ofus would have a hard time finding our way around our Macs. Imagine thatif instead of eachitem on your hard drive having an icon that indicateswhat it is, each item was exactly the same.</P><P><B>Applications, documents, and system stuff.</B></P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/appicn.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" vspace="4" hspace="4"><IMG SRC="../../images/docicn.gif"WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" vspace="4" hspace="4"><IMG SRC="../../images/icnpref.gif" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="4"hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><IMG SRC="../../images/findericn.gif" WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Atthe simplest level icons represent applications, documents and a basic setof system items such as the System, Finder, folders, Extensions, ControlPanels and Preferences. These three classes of icons are the basis for almostall other icons.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Application Icons</B></P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/icnttp2.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" vspace="4" hspace="4"><IMG SRC="../../images/icnTE.gif"WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" vspace="4" hspace="4"><IMG SRC="../../images/icnXPress.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="4"hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><IMG SRC="../../images/icndsu.gif" WIDTH="32"HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">PersonallyI'm a big stickler on user interface guidelines. These guidelines are amajor part of what makes a Mac a Mac. When program designers follow theseguidelines it makes a program more Mac like. The very first part of thisinterface we see for any application are the icons associated with thatapplication. User interface guidelines are a part of what helps a programbe intuitive. The very first part of this initial intuitiveness is knowingwhat to do after a program is installed. Usually this involves clickingon the Icon for the application.</P><P>Application icons generally follow the pattern of being somewhat diamondshaped with a hand holding a pencil . Although application icons generallyfollows this theme each one will follow its own unique aspects that attemptto describe some of the functionality if the application it represents.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/icnclwrks.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="RIGHT"vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><IMG SRC="../../images/icnfm.gif"WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" vspace="4" hspace="4"><IMG SRC="../../images/icnEmailer.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="4"hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Some great examples of application iconsare those that came from the former Claris Corporation. You could tell ata single glance a number of things about the application it represented.All of the application icons from Claris follow the similar theme of a whitesquare with a blue rectangle in the upper left corner. Then each one hasan icon the exemplifies the function of the application itself.</P><P>Although a good Icon can't make a terrible program function well, a badone can put a bad face on a great application.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Document Icons</B></P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/icntexed.gif" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT"vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><IMG SRC="../../images/docemaier.gif"WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="RIGHT" hspace="4" vspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><IMG SRC="../../images/icnBBed.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT"vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><IMG SRC="../../images/icnstuf.gif"WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><IMG SRC="../../images/icnfmpdoc.gif" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT"vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><IMG SRC="../../images/icnclwrksdoc.gif"WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Document icons generally flow naturally from the application that createdit both from a design perspective and in the way the Mac OS deals with them.</P><P>Well designed document icons are a natural extension of the applicationicons for the programs that create them. You should be able to take onelook at an icon for a document and be able to know what application willbe launched when it is double clicked. The classic document icon is thatof a blank page with a folded corner. Most document icon will more or lessfollow that theme.</P><P>The designers of the Mac OS understood that it was likely that you wouldhave many documents created by each application you have. Knowing this oneto many ratio they decided to not include document icons in document thedocuments themselves but rather to have the documents link back to the programthat created them. This linking is handled through two 4 letter codes thatare set for every file on your Mac. One code describes the type of filethe other describes what application created it.</P><P>The Desktop Database of your Mac handles this linking of documents tothe applications that created them. It is similar to the three letter extensions(i.e. file.doc) that the windows world has conformed to for years exceptthat it is an integral part of Mac OS files not just an extension to thefilenames. This is why you don't see the icons for files that you don'thave the application that created them. If for some reason you aren't seeingthe icons for documents for which you do have the creator application adesktop rebuild is most likely in order. Holding down Command and Optionon startup will provide you with an opportunity to do so.

These are iconsare ones such as the System suitcase, the Finder icon, folders, Extensions,Control Panels and Preferences. Where the icons for applications and thedocuments they create are stored within the application, most of the Systemicons are stored within the system suitcase. (With the exception of mostof the printer icons which are stored in the Finder.) System icons are whathelp us to recognize what type of file a particular one might be. A partof the beauty of the Mac OS is that Apple and software developers alikemore or less adhere to some basic forms for the creation of icons for itemsthat will be placed in the System Folder. Extensions are created in theform of a puzzle pieces, Control panels have a little slider at the sideor bottom, preferences have two radio buttons that indicate that they containsettings. This elegance is part of what places the Mac OS on a level allits own.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Custom Icons</B></P><P><A HREF="http://www.blueskyheart.com/"><IMG SRC="../../images/icnblusky.gif"WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><IMG SRC="../../images/icnhat.gif" WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="RIGHT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" vspace="4" hspace="4"><A HREF="http://www.iconfactory.com/"><IMG SRC="../../images/icnmac.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/ikthusian/icons.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/icnikthu.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0"vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A>The third set of icons arethose that are manually placed on a document or folder.</P><P>Custom icons rarely perform any function besides providing somethingcool to look at or as a visual descriptor of the contents of a certain folderor file.</P><P><B>Icons are just little pictures.</B></P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/keikoresicn.gif" WIDTH="243" HEIGHT="148" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">I will occasionally getquestions about how the picture that is on a certain icon effects its functionality.Like why do some control panels have the little slider on the bottom andothers have it on the side. Or with system extensions, why some are a verticalpuzzle pieces and others are horizontal.</P><P>At the core, all icons are is little pictures. They have no impact onthe functioning of the files they represent. Any icon could just as easilybe a picture of a taco or a St. Bernard puppy or anything else and it wouldn'thave any impact on the functioning of the file for folder.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/keikoset.gif" WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="296" ALIGN="LEFT"vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">In Mac OS 8, icons are comprisedof a set of pictures that include all the necessary displays of an icon.This set of pictures includes all the possible icon displays including asmall (16 by 16 pixels) and large (32 by 32 pixels) versions in 256 colors,16 colors, and black &amp; white. The set also includes a mask that stateswhich parts of the icon should be transparent. The Mac OS then translatesthat icon set into all the possible states of an icon like open, closed,selected, or offline.</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Customizing Icons</B></P><P>Customizing icons can be as simple as cutting and pasting. The classicmethod of placing a custom icon on an item is through the 'Get Info' window.Simply selecting the file or folder for which you want to customize theicon and choosing 'Get Info' from the 'File' menu. A click on the icon willselect it and choosing copy, cut, or paste from the 'Edit' menu will copy,remove or replace the icon. If the item you are customizing is a file, theicon will be embedded in the resources for the file. If you are modifyingthe icon for a folder, an invisible file will be created in the folder tostore the icon. This icon will then replace the one that is being displayedfor that file.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Getting Icons</B></P><P>The source for an icon can either be from a previously created icon ora picture that you might have or create.</P><P><B>Making your own icons.</B></P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/icnkeiko.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="LEFT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" vspace="4" hspace="4"><IMG SRC="../../images/keikopic.jpg"WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="180" ALIGN="RIGHT" hspace="4" vspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Given that icons are just little pictures you can easily create themyourself. You can use almost any image editing program to create them. Asimple cut and paste will place any image as an icon. The Mac OS will automaticallyresample the image down to conform with the 32 by 32 pixel size and alsofills in all the smaller and different versions of the icon so it will functionjust like any other icon.</P><P>Serious icon designers use many different tools in the creation of icons.At the core of any icon designers tool box is a program that will allowthe editing of resources. Resources are containers for different elementsof a program. The most common and free resource editor is ResEdit from Apple.You can use it to take a look at the innards of applications or some files.ResExcelence is a site dedicated to resource editing.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/keikofolinf.gif" WIDTH="241" HEIGHT="217" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Where cutting and pastingin the 'Get Info' window is effective for simple moving and creating ofbasic icons, ResEdit allows you to edit each element of an icon pixel bypixel. Some icon designers boast in the fact that they only use ResEditin the creation of their icons.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/icnresed.gif" WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" vspace="4" hspace="4">Opening ResEdit (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/US/Macintosh/Utilities/ResEdit_2.1.3.txt">read</A>,<A HREF="ftp://ftphqx.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/US/Macintosh/Utilities/ResEdit_2.1.3.sea.hqx">download</A>)will allow you to choose a file you want to edit. If you want to edit theicon for a folder you only need to look in the folder for a file calledIcon. Opening up that file will give you access to the icon of the foldercontaining it. Once you have the file opened in ResEdit you will see thatyou have access to many aspects of that file. It can be fun to poke aroundor even change the items you see in there but be aware that you should alwayswork with copies, not original files. It is possible to damage files irreparablywith ResEdit so you always want to make sure you have a backup of each fileyou edit.<A HREF="http://www.resexcellence.com/"> ResExcellence</A> is asite dedicated to Mac resource editing.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/icl8.gif" WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="153" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" vspace="4" hspace="4">Once a file is opened in yourresource editing application you will want to find one of the resourcesthat point to the icon set. I usually look for one called &quot;icl8&quot;.Others that point to the icon set are &quot;icl4&quot;, &quot;ICN#&quot;,&quot;ics#&quot;, &quot;ics4&quot;, and &quot;ics8&quot;. Double clickingany of these will open the pointer to the icon set. Opening that icon setwill allow you to edit the icon pixel by pixel.</P><P>When I have occasion to create an icon I actually use a combination ofthe above mentioned methods. I will first do a simple paste in the &quot;GetInfo&quot; window to create the basic form of the icon I desire. Then Iwill use a resource editor to modify that icon to the way I want it.</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/Keikoediticn.gif" WIDTH="243" HEIGHT="148" ALIGN="RIGHT" vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Although it can be funto create your own icons it takes a lot of skill to create an icon thatis both esthetically pleasing and well describes the file, folder or applicationit represents with a canvas only 32 pixels square and only 256 colors tochoose from. Apple is taking a big step forward with Mac OS 8.5 in termsof custom icons. Apple is expanding the possible size to 48 by 48 pixelsand allowing the possibility of thousands of colors. Mac OS 8.5 will alsoimplement technology that will allow icons to interact with the backgroundthey are on. This interaction is called antialiasing and will create iconsthat appear more realistic.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Icon sites</B></P><P>Now that you know all about using and creating custom icons you can havea lot of fun finding and using custom icons. There are a number of sitesand individuals that have spent considerable amounts of time creating andgathering custom icons. Below you will find a number of icon sites thatwill get you started. Most custom icons are freeware (i.e. you don't haveto pay anything to use them.) or shareware. Please honor the wishes of theicon creators and only use them within the stated boundaries.</P><P>A few key icon sites are listed below most of which also have a linkspage which will lead you to many other Mac icon sites on the Web. Thesesites should get you started and the links pages can keep you busy for hours.</P><P><A HREF="http://www.iconfactory.com/"><B><IMG SRC="../../images/top12.gif"WIDTH="49" HEIGHT="45" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0" vspace="4" hspace="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">the icon factory</B> </A>is a great source for somecool mac icons.

[<A HREF="http://www.iconplanet.com/links.html">Links page</A>]</P><P><B>Performance Considerations</B></P><P>The one thing to keep in mind before you go too crazy in customizingevery icon under the sun is that there is a small impact to performancewhen custom icons are used. Every time you view a custom icon the invisibleicon file needs to be read from your hard drive. This performance impactis minimal but can be measured in cases where many custom icons are in use.These performance effects are more evident for files that are stored onservers over a network. If you are really concerned with performance youmight want to use custom icons on a limited basis. If putting a smile onyour face is of high priority I wouldn't worry about the small impact thatcustom icons can have on performance.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>I hope this MacTip will contribute to the enjoyment of your Mac. I am  interested to see how different people use custom icons. If you want to  share yours, please send a screen shot of your Mac so I can take a look.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><AHREF="../index.html" TARGET="">MacTips</A> || <A HREF="../contact.shtml"TARGET="">Feedback</A> || <A HREF="../archive.shtml" TARGET="">MacTips Archive</A>|| <A HREF="http://www.themacintoshguy.com">The Macintosh Guy</A> <!-- #EndLibraryItem --></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></P><P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>This site, its source code, and the MacTips logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice.
