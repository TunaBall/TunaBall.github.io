Now that you are grounded in the basics it is      time to move on to some of the tools of the trade. There are      tools that can help in creating, storing and displaying custom      icons.</P>      <P>Working on these icon tips has been really fun for me. I don't      think I have ever come across so many nice people all in one      arena of software before. I was amazed when person after person      and company after company was willing to either send me a full      copy of their product for evaluation or to offer copies in the      MacTip announcement giveaway. Various companies and individuals      have agreed to provide a total of 33 copies of their various      products to a member of the MacTip announcement list.<B> Thanks      everyone!</B></P>      <P>Icon tools generally fall into one of three categories. <B>Collecting</B>,      <B>altering</B>, or <B>displaying</B>. Icon collecting tools      are ones that make retrieving and storing thousands of icons      a snap. The tools for altering icons range from acting like a      rubber stamp to mini-Photoshop applications. The couple of tools      that automate the displaying can make easy work of customizing      your plain old folders or files.</P>      <P>Each of the tools mentioned are being actively developed and      the companies that created them were very responsive to my increase      about them. There were a couple tools that I chose not to mention      either because they haven't been updated for a couple years or      I was unable to find sufficient information about them. Those      listed below are definitely ones that stood out to me as &quot;Cool      Iconic Tools&quot;!</P>      <P><B>Collecting Icons</B></P>      <P>Collecting icons is something I haven't spent much time doing      for years. There was a time when I had floppies and floppies      (800k floppies that is) full of icons. Each icon was stored on      a separate empty folder on the disk. Each floppy contained a      different genre of icons. I had ones for icons of cartoons, household      items, movie stars, each Mac model, commercial logos, cars, etc.      Needless to say, my archiving method lacked elegance but it worked.</P>      <P>Since my days of black and white icons on 800k floppies many      icon archiving solutions have come and gone. Even though it has      been a while since I did a lot of icon collecting I had a lot      of fun grabbing icons from around the net to test these products      with.</P>      <P>Although it has become a much less significant issue with      HFS+ and expansive hard drives, the initial need for icon archives      was primarily logistical. Each icon (an invisible file stored      within the folder that is displaying it) is only a couple kilobytes      in size it will occupy a minimum amount of space on the hard      drive. With smaller drives and drives formatted with Apple's      new extended disk format HFS+ this is rarely much larger than      the file itself. But in the case of larger drives, this can be      many times the size of the icon file itself. When this is multiplied      over potentially thousands of icons you can end up taking a significant      amount of space. Icon archiving utilities deal with this by storing      many icons in a single file on your hard drive. For example,      1000 custom icons that occupy only about 600 kb when archived      in an icon storage utility can take up more than 6 megabytes      (10 times the space) on a 4 gig drive. (The same files on a HFS+      volume only occupy about 1.6 megabytes.)</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P><IMG SRC="../../images/icniconarch.gif" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="32"      ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/iconcollection.gif"      WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="103" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><B><A      HREF="http://www.montalcini.com/">Icon Archiver 3.0</A> </B>by      Alessandro Levi Montalcini ($25 shareware)</P>      <P>Icon Archiver was the most initially compelling icon storage      tool. Within a few minutes of launching the program I was able      to collect hundreds of icons into an 'Icon Collection' and get      them back out again.</P>      <P>Opening Icon Archiver 3.0 presents you with an icon collection      window. A simple drag of any Finder item will set Icon Archiver      on its way extracting any icons out of those items. Get ready      to be surprised. Dragging a small partition of my hard drive      resulted in thousands of extracted icons. Just dragging the Adobe      Photoshop folder over resulted in 413 icons. Removing the duplicates      brought it down to 382. If this quantity seems as daunting to      you as it did to me don't worry. Icon Archiver also has some      incredible sorting and filtering capabilities that can provide      you with exactly the results you seek.</P>      <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../images/iconarchcoll.gif" WIDTH="257"      HEIGHT="114" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>      <P>In addition to being able to extract icons from any standard      documents and applications, Icon Archiver also is able extract      the icons from the other icon collecting tools by just dragging      their files to the Icon Collection.</P>      <P><IMG SRC="../../images/iconarchmenu.gif" WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="187"      ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Icon Archiver isn't only intuitive      in how it collects icons. If you want to get your icons back      out, perhaps to share with friends or to use for custom folders      or to use on other files your icons are only a drag away. Selecting      one or many icons and dragging them to the Finder will provide      you with each selected icon in the format you choose from a menu.</P>      <P><IMG SRC="../../images/iconsticker.gif" WIDTH="173" HEIGHT="149"      ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The Icon Sticker is Icon Archiver's      quick and easy way to modify the icons in your Finder. The simple      instructions right in the window tell it all.</P>      <P>To sum it up, Icon Archiver is the easiest way to collect      every icon from you hard drive and get them back out again. Its      simple elegance and sorting/filtering power make it a very cool      icon collecting tool.</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P><B><IMG SRC="../../images/icnIconDropp.gif" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="32"      ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><A HREF="http://www.iconfactory.com/icon.htm">IconDropper</A>      </B>by the <A HREF="http://www.iconfactory.com/">IconFactory</A>      ($20 shareware)</P>      <P>IconDropper is from those icon kings at the Icon Factory.      I must admit that the single coolest thing about IconDropper      is that all the icon sets from the Icon Factory come in this      format. Icon Dropper's strength comes in the organization it      allows and the clean display of icon collections. When you launch      IconDropper you are presented with a split interface. One side      shows the hierarchy of Icon Packs contained in the Packs folder      and the other side shows the icons that comprise that pack including      titles and information about the pack itself. IconDropper packs      are clearly the slickest way for an icon artist to distribute      their icons.</P>      <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../images/IconDropper.gif" WIDTH="411"      HEIGHT="233" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>      <P><IMG SRC="../../images/dragthis.gif" WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="46"      ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">IconDropper also provides an      easy to move these icons to your desktop. Each item that you      drag onto the IconDropper icon will quickly be modified with      the icon you then choose from the Icon Dropper window.</P>      <P><IMG SRC="../../images/iconpacker.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"      ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The other half of IconDropper      is <B>IconPacker</B>. IconPacker is what a registered user of      IconDropper can use to create icon packs. Interestingly enough      it is almost easier to create the icon packs with IconPacker      than it is to view them in IconDropper. It provides full control      of how your icons are presented including naming each icon, the      icon set and a healthy amount of room to display an image that      will set the theme of the icon set. IconDropper, IconPacker,      and the IconFactory are a great combination that delivers clean      and fun icons in a clean and fun interface.</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Altering Icons</FONT></B></P>      <P>When it comes to altering Icons or creating your own there      are really two classes of products. There are resource editors      like ResEdit and Resourcerer which are basically for pixel by      pixel editing of icons (in addition to editing most other interface      elements of applications) and there are applications that are      specifically designed for editing and modifying icons.</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P><IMG SRC="../../images/keikoresicn.gif" WIDTH="243" HEIGHT="148"      ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/icnresed.gif"      WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><B><A      HREF="ftp://ftp.info.apple.com/Apple.Support.Area/Apple.Software.Updates/US/Macintosh/Utilities/ResEdit_2.1.3.txt">ResEdit</A></B>      from <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</A> (Freeware) <FONT       SIZE="-1">[<B><A HREF="ftp://ftp.info.apple.com/Apple.Support.Area/Apple.Software.Updates/US/Macintosh/Utilities/ResEdit_2.1.3.sea.bin">Download</A></B>]</FONT></P>      <P>ResEdit is the longtime Mac geek standby. ResEdit can be used      to alter most every part of the Macintosh interface. Whether      you are hacking into the system file or editing key parts of      an application, ResEdit is a tool that makes it all possible.      (<A HREF="tip36.shtml">MacTip #36</A> discusses getting started      with ResEdit to edit your icons.) The single best feature of      ResEdit is the price, its free as a download from Apple. Although      ResEdit is enough to do the job it is more for those who honor      the purity of basic tools. With ResEdit you end up editing your      icon pixel by pixel. Great for some but many appreciate the control      that can be found in some of the other icon editing programs.      BTW, <A HREF="http://www.resexcellence.com/">ResExcellence</A>      is a site dedicated to things that can be done with resource      editors like ResEdit.</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P><IMG SRC="../../images/icnresourcerer.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="32"      ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/resourcicnedit.gif"      WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="125" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><B><A      HREF="http://www.mathemaesthetics.com/ResorcererInfo.html">Resourcerer</A></B>      from <A HREF="http://www.mathemaesthetics.com/">Mathemaesthetics</A>      ($256 commercial software)</P>      <P>Resourcerer is the commercial counterpart to ResEdit. Even      though it can cost a pretty penny it is a great tool for the      serious Mac user to have around. It allows for searching and      comparing of files, and lays out the different parts of a piece      of software in a manner that places it a cut above ResEdit. Although      Resourcerer is a very cool resource editing tool I can't say      that it is worth purchasing it just for editing icons.</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P><IMG SRC="../../images/icniconmachine.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"      ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/iconmachedit.gif"      WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="163" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><B><A      HREF="http://www.kagi.com/dathorc/iconmachine.html">Icon Machine</A></B>      by <A HREF="http://www.kagi.com/dathorc/index.html">David Thoreau      Catmull</A> ($20 Shareware)</P>      <P>In researching this MacTip I asked a few icon artists what      they used for creating icons. Some were staunch pixel by pixel      ResEdit advocates but other than that Icon Machine was to tool      of choice.</P>      <P>Honestly, after launching Icon Machine the first time I was      wondering what everyone was so excited about. Sure it has a clean      interface and simple usable tools but in looking at it I didn't      see anything earthshaking. Then I picked up the pencil and started      to draw. Even though it used the same 32 x 32 pixel square as      every other icon editor there was a fluidity that even made me      feel like I could create something of beauty. Icon Machine has      a way of making a little square of 1024 pixels feel like an expansive      painter's canvas.</P>      <P>Icon Machine is truly Photoshop for icons. If you're comfortable      with Photoshop, Icon Machine will be a welcome extension to what      you already know. If you don't know Photoshop, this would be      a good place to start learning.</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P><IMG SRC="../../images/icnCME.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"      NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><B><A HREF="http://www.riccisoft.com/icontools/">IconTools</A></B>      from <A HREF="http://www.riccisoft.com/">Riccisoft</A> ($15 Shareware)</P>      <P>IconTools was the one cool iconic tool that actually made      me laugh out loud when I first saw it do its thing. IconTools      is a contextual menu plug-in and therefore requires Mac OS 8      or later. IconTools works on the premise of tools, stamps and      frames.

With      the release of Mac OS 8.5 Apple will reportedly release a new      icon format that will take them up into thousands of colors (instead      of 256) and increase the size to 48 x 48 (instead of 32 x 32).      Some of the software developers I talked to were very excited      about the new possibilities available with the new icons. It      will be exciting to see where things go from here.</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P>I hope this MacTip has given you a good picture of some of      the Cool Iconic Tools available for the Mac OS. I know that most      of what was covered won't make your Mac run any faster or more      efficiently but it may put a smile on your face. I hope you take      the time to make your Mac a little more fun to look at and work      with.</P>      <P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P>      <P ALIGN=CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></P>      <P ALIGN=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><A      HREF="../index.html" TARGET="">MacTips</A> || <A HREF="../contact.shtml"      TARGET="">Feedback</A> || <A HREF="../archive.shtml" TARGET="">MacTips      Archive</A> || <A HREF="http://www.themacintoshguy.com">The      Macintosh Guy</A> <!-- #EndLibraryItem --></P>      <P ALIGN=CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></P>      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1">This site, its source code, and the MacTips      logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice.
