When it is doing its job and setup properly      you will not even notice it is there. I would bet that there      are many people who have used it for a long time and didn't know      what was behind the scenes doing the job. And best of all, it      is free.</P>      <P><B>Internet Config</B> bills itself as a single place to enter      all your Internet preferences. IC indeed does that but it does      even more. Not only will it keep you from entering your preferences      in every application but it also acts as a traffic cop, telling      your Mac which application to use for each thing you want to      do.</P>      <P>Internet Config is included in Mac OS 8 and many applications      so you will likely have at least one copy already installed on      your machine. (I had five copies when I started this MacTip!)</P>      <P>Internet Config has been around for a long time. Version 1.0      was released in 1994 and version 2.0 was released the end of      1997. Most people have version 1.3 or 1.4 installed so you might      want to go and download version 2.0 <A HREF="ftp://ftp.stairways.com/stairways/internetconfig-20.sit.bin">from      here</A> to be sure you have the latest update.</P>      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Internet Config isn't just a program; it      is a system.</FONT></B></P>      <P>The first thing to understand is that IC does very little      by itself. IC was designed as a system for handling the different      types of information and protocols that make their way across      the Internet. For IC to do its job an application needs to support      the standard IC has set in place. Different applications support      the Internet Config standard in varying amounts and in different      ways.</P>      <P>One thing that you will find interesting about looking at      the IC documentation is that there are absolutely no limitations      on how it can be used. We can thank Quinn &quot;The Eskimo&quot;      and Peter N Lewis for their forethought in making this system      as open as possible, that openness has allowed software developers      to incorporate its features and include the software in their      products. This openness has even (reportedly) allowed Apple to      make it a part of Mac OS 8.5 and an integral part of the Mac      OS.</P>      <P>Internet Config's features generally fall into three categories      shared preferences, file mappings, and helper applications.</P>      <P><B>Shared Settings</B><BR>      <IMG SRC="../../images/ICsetsmenu.gif" WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="139"      ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Enter them once;      use them all over. The stated purpose of Internet Config is to      allow you to enter your Internet preferences in one place and      access them from any application that needs them. More applications      now support the IC system than ever. Some applications require      IC and use it as the interface for entering these preferences.      Some other applications provide users the option of using IC      or using fields provided by the application for entering these      preferences.<BR>      Examples of Applications that require IC to function are <A       HREF="http://www.stairways.com/anarchie/">Anarchie</A> (a file      transfer application), <A HREF="http://www.inx.de/%7estk/macsoup/index.html">MacSoup</A>,      and some other applications. If you try to use any of these applications      when IC is not installed you will be unable to continue until      it is installed and configured with the necessary information.<BR>      <IMG SRC="../../images/ICemailer.gif" WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="151"       ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Many other applications      don't require IC but contain a check box in the preferences that      will allow you to switch to using the IC system. This will allow      you to enter all your internet preferences like email access      information, Web browser home page, key download sites, etc.      only once and be able to access them from each application that      might need them.<BR>      <B>IC Setting Sets.<BR>      </B>Not only does Internet Config provide a single place to enter      users Internet preferences; it is also capable of handling information      for multiple people, profiles or locations. Inside the IC application      there is a sets menu where you can define different &quot;sets&quot;      (Select 'Duplicate' and then 'Rename...' from the 'Sets' menu      to create a new one). Once you have multiple &quot;sets&quot;      setup you can simply select the one you desire from the menu.      This is useful when you have multiple people using the same machine,      or when you use the same machine for multiple Internet identities.      A good example of this might be using a single machine for both      business and personal use. IC allows you to switch all your settings      between your business identity and your personal identity faster      than Clark Kent can change into Super Man.<BR>      <IMG SRC="../../images/ICstripmenu.gif" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="94"      ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/ICstripman.gif"      WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Internet      Config 2.0 includes a couple new ways to switch between settings      other than launching the Internet Config application; you will      find the keys to these in the &quot;Goodies&quot; folder that      comes with IC 2.0. The first is a control strip module called      &quot;Internet Config Switch&quot;. This when used in conjunction      with Apple's Control Strip allows the user to dynamically choose      from the available sets with the click of the mouse.<BR>      <IMG SRC="../../images/IClocman.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="LEFT"      BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The other way that you can move      between the different settings is through Apple's Location Manager      for PowerBooks. Placing the &quot;Internet Config Set&quot; location      manager state module into the &quot;Location Manager Modules&quot;      folder will allow you to switch IC settings along with all the      other settings controlled by the Location Manager.</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P><CENTER><A HREF="tip38b.shtml">Now continue on to part 2 and      see File Mappings and Helpers can make your life easier.</A></CENTER></P>      <H2>&nbsp;</H2>      <P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>      <P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>      <P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>      <P><CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></CENTER></P>      <P><CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><A      HREF="../index.html" TARGET="">MacTips</A> || <A HREF="../contact.shtml"      TARGET="">Feedback</A> || <A HREF="../archive.shtml" TARGET="">MacTips      Archive</A> || <A HREF="http://www.themacintoshguy.com">The      Macintosh Guy</A> <!-- #EndLibraryItem --></CENTER></P>      <P><CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></CENTER></P>      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1">This site, its source code, and the MacTips      logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice.
