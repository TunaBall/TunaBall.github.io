You see the Internet      was created in a Unix/Dos/PC world and it still works around      the same assumptions that were made about how computers work      so many years ago. One of the core side effects of this is that      Macintosh files can't live unprotected on the Internet. If you      send a Macintosh file out onto the Internet without any pre-processing      most of them will be destroyed or corrupted.<BR>      Macintosh files are embedded with special information that tells      the Mac OS what type of file it is and what application created      it, files on the Internet can't hold this information. In the      Unix/Dos/PC world the only way to tell what kind of file you      are looking at is by the three letters that follow the file name.      This is why every file you look at from the Internet will have      this three-letter extension following ever file. For example      Windows applications have the extension of &quot;.exe&quot;,      Photoshop files have the extension of &quot;.psd&quot;, JPEG      files have the extension of &quot;.jpg&quot;, and Word documents      have the extension of &quot;.doc&quot;. Normally a Mac won't      understand what to do with these files unless it is specifically      told what to do with them.<BR>      It is the File Mappings section of Internet Config that allows      the entry of correlating Macintosh information to these three      letter extensions.<BR>      You will notice that most Macintosh files you download over the      Internet have these three letter extensions. Most Macintosh downloads      will have either a &quot;.bin&quot;, &quot;.hqx&quot;, or &quot;.sit&quot;      extensions. These three file formats represent specific file      formats that are actually safe transport vehicles that contain      Macintosh files inside of them. While we will leave the specifics      of each of file format for a later MacTip, generally the BinHex      format (&quot;.hqx&quot;) is the most reliable and safe. If you      have the choice and are having trouble with either of the others      you may have better luck with the BinHex version.<BR>      The <B>File Mappings</B> section of IC will not only allow a      user to associate Macintosh information with downloaded files      but it will also allow those files to be passed to another program      for post-processing. Many Macintosh users are in the habit of      downloading files and then dragging them to the application they      want to open it with. Post-processing automatically opens the      downloaded file with the chosen application. In most cases post-processing      usually involves either decoding or decompressing a file that      has been downloaded.<BR>      <A HREF="http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/expander_mac.html">Stuffit      Expander</A> is the most popular post-processing utility. Stuffit      Expander is included with most web browsers and is a part of      the Mac OS Internet installer. Stuffit Expander is able to decode      and decompress most files downloaded from the Internet, choosing      it as the post-processing application for the three types of      files mentioned above will allow it to convert most every download      into usable Macintosh files.<BR>      You can choose a post-process application by choosing the extension      from the File Mappings list. If you don't see the one you want      you can click &quot;Add&quot; to add it. Checking the &quot;Post-Process:&quot;      check box and selecting an application will cause any file downloaded      with that three-letter extension to be automatically opened with      that extension.</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Helpers</FONT></B><BR>      <IMG SRC="../../images/IChelpersdlog.gif" WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="157"      ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../../images/IChelpers.gif"      WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Although      the centralization and switching of preferences is a big part      of Internet Config, it is much more than just that.<BR>      The part of Internet Config that I use on a daily basis is the      launching of a particular Internet application for each individual      Internet protocol. For those who use the all-in-one Internet      access applications like AOL this isn't a significant an issue,      when you click an email address in AOL, it assumes you want to      use AOL to send the email. But for those like me who use one      application for looking at web pages, another for reading email,      another for downloading files, and still another for reading      Usenet, Internet Config offers a little sanity and cohesion between      all these programs. Each of these protocols has a certain type      of URL (Uniform Resource Locator) associated with it. IC links      these URLs to specific applications you choose. The primary vehicle      of this linking is through a Command-Click. Most of the current      Internet applications support this Command-Clicking. Adding the      &quot;ICeTEe&quot; extension (found in the &quot;Goodies&quot;      folder) to your System folder will allow most other applications      to support Command-Clicking including SimpleText. The most common      types of URLs are those for web pages (http), sending email (mailto),      and downloading files (ftp). If you take the time to setup these      three with a web browser (i.e. Navigator or Explorer), email      client (i.e. Em@iler, Outlook, Eudora, etc.) and a file transfer      client (i.e. Anarchie or Fetch) they should meet most of a typical      users needs. These helper applications are also used in many      applications when you click a button or menu item that contains      a URL to a web site or an email address.<BR>      Once you have your helper applications setup you should never      have to copy and paste an email address or URL ever again. Simply      do a Command-Click and the URL is opened with the application      of your choice.</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Remember IC is a System.</FONT></B><BR>      Although IC is great for entering Internet information it is      important to keep in mind that it is only as good as the applications      that support it. Some applications support IC perfectly, some      support it partially and others don't support it at all. Be sure      to check the documentation for the application ou are using to      see how it works with Internet Config.</P>      <BLOCKQUOTE>        <BLOCKQUOTE>          <P>I hope this MacTip has been usefull in understanding the basics          of how Internet Config work and will allow you to more productive          on the Internet.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>      </BLOCKQUOTE>      <P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P>      <P ALIGN=CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P ALIGN=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><A      HREF="../index.html" TARGET="">MacTips</A> || <A HREF="../contact.shtml"      TARGET="">Feedback</A> || <A HREF="../archive.shtml" TARGET="">MacTips      Archive</A> || <A HREF="http://www.themacintoshguy.com">The      Macintosh Guy</A> <!-- #EndLibraryItem --></P>      <P ALIGN=CENTER><HR SIZE="4"></P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1">This site, its source code, and the MacTips      logo &copy;1996-2016 Eric Prentice.
