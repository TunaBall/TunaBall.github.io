While Mac OS 9 offers some really neat features most are either refinements of current technology or foundational improvements that will allow software developers to do cool things in the future.</p><p>Every time Apple comes out with a new version of the Mac OS there are always people telling you all kinds of information about it. Even before it is released you will be able to know how your old programs will run with it, where to buy it, how much you can pay, long lists of all the new features, and even the latest bugs that have been found.</p><p>This MacTip is a step by step guide to installing Mac OS 9 that attempts to cut through all the marketing stuff and tell you exactly what goes where.</p><p><b>Pre-Install Considerations.<br></b>A couple of things to consider about <b>before you install OS 9.</b> Any time you're doing a major system overhaul you will most likely need to re-enter some or many of your system settings, given that you will be spending some time configuring your system you may want to take the opportunity to do something more thorough like getting that new larger hard drive or <a href="tip10.shtml">partitioning</a> your current hard drive. I won't take the time in this MacTip to outline every precaution to take before installing a system update but tip #12 <a href="tip12.shtml">&quot;System Installs etc.&quot;</a> although a bit dated covers some of those issues.</p><p>The <b>safest way to install Mac OS 9</b> is on a freshly formatted hard drive. Unfortunately most people don't have the luxury of being able to reformat their hard drive at any time. The next best option would be a &quot;<a href="tip12.shtml">Clean Install</a>&quot;. Simply checking the &quot;Perform Clean Install&quot; check box after clicking the &quot;Options&quot; button on the &quot;Select Destination&quot; screen will disable your old system folder and give you a new one. If you don't have enough free disk space (100-250 MB) to do a clean install you will want to use your Extensions Manager to disable all the non-Apple control panels and extensions before installing the new system. After the update you will only want to re-enable those disabled components after verifying that they are compatible with Mac OS 9. (<a href="http://www.macintouch.com/m90_compatibility.html">Here</a> and <a href="http://www.macfixit.com/reports/macos9.shtml">here</a> are a couple places to look for compatibility information.)</p><center><p><img height="100" width="300" src="../../images/cleancheck.gif"></p></center><p>Mac OS 9 provides you with the opportunity to install any combination of <b>10 different components</b> that comprise Mac OS 9. Apple has done a great job with introducing assistants that will help you setup the software after it has been installed but it is close to impossible to know from the list of titles and check boxes exactly what you are installing in the first place.</p><center><p><img height="118" width="363" src="../../images/OS9inst.gif"></p></center><p>While running 'Mac OS Install' simply <b>click the 'Customize' button</b> to see all 10 components in the &quot;Install Software&quot; part of the install.</p><center><p><img height="317" width="363" src="../../images/OS9custom.gif"></p></center><div align="left"><p>A standard install of Mac OS 9 requires about 200 MB on your hard drive. A minimal install of Mac OS 9 takes up about 80 MB on your drive. Installing everything requires almost 300 MB. Keep in mind that the default setting for the Mac OS is to have Virtual Memory enabled. With virtual memory, you will require an amount of disk space at least as much as the RAM you have installed. If you have 64 MB of RAM then you can count on needing at least 65 MB of hard drive space beyond the space the system files take up on your drive.</p><p>Although Mac OS 9 does take some great steps in the development of the Mac OS it does require a fair amount of RAM. A standard install results in about 25 MB of RAM being used just for the System software. This same install with Virtual memory off jumps up over 37 MB. If you were to install all the components of Mac OS 9, the memory requirements for Mac OS 9 can go as high as 47 MB with virtual memory off.</p><p>If you are considering upgrading to Mac OS 9 you should consider upgrading to at least 64 MB of RAM. With Mac OS 9, Apple says the minimum requirements are 32 MB of RAM and requires virtual memory set to 40 MB. At this setting you will see a significant performance hit using virtual memory. Real memory is always better than the virtual kind. (All tests done on the G3, 400 with the disk cache set to 2048k)</p></div><center><p>&nbsp;</p></center><p><b>What to install?</b></p><p><b>To help you decide</b> what to install I have provided three levels of recommendation for what you should install. Keep in mind that these are my recommendations based on my views of how most people use their Macs. I realize that there will certainly be notable exceptions to these recommendations and please feel free to install whatever components you feel will meet your needs. Also note that as Mac OS 9 is your &quot;Internet co-pilot&quot; I assume that you have an Internet connection when making my reccomendations. Remember in almost every case these components can be added and removed at any time, so there is no pressure to install something you aren't sure you will need. If at a later date you have the need for a certain component not originally installed you can just install it later.</p><center><p></p><table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0"><tr><td width="17%" valign="top" align="center"><b><img src="../../images/exclamation.gif" width="26" height="36" align="TOP" vspace="2" hspace="2" naturalsizeflag="3"></b></td><td width="83%"><b>Just Install it!</b> Components with the exclamation point beside them are ones that practically everyone will be able to take advantage of and see the benefits from.</td></tr><tr><td width="17%">&nbsp;</td><td width="83%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="17%" valign="top" align="center"><b><img src="../../images/check.gif" width="33" height="30" align="TOP" vspace="2" hspace="2" naturalsizeflag="3"></b></td><td width="83%"><b>You might want to install this.</b> Components with the check mark are ones that depending on your connection to the Internet or how you use your Mac some will want to install, and others may not.
