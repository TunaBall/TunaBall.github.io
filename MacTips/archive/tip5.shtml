These filesare invisible because there is usually no reason to do anything with themexcept to let them do their job.</H4><P><B>Why have invisible files? </B>Apple has done a real good job of lettingMacintosh users have access to what they need and keeping them from changingthings that might cause problems or would otherwise confuse things. Oneway they have done this is to make certain files invisible so that thereis no way to accidentally move or delete them.</P><P><B>What are some invisible files and what do they do? </B>There are anumber of invisible files on the Macintosh you are using right now. Haveyou ever seen a folder on a Mac that has an icon that has been customizedto look like something other than a normal Mac folder? What someone hasdone is pasted a custom icon into the 'Get Info' window for that folder.What they have really done is created a small invisible file called 'Icon'on their hard drive that is linked to that folder.</P><P>Another set of invisible files are those related to Open Transport orClassic Networking on any non-PCI Mac running 7.5.3 or later. Without gettinginto the details of both of these networking setups you can either run oneor the other. When you are using one, the other's control panels, etc. aremade invisible as to not to confuse the user.</P><P>Another set of invisible files are those related to the Desktop Databasewhich we will discuss a little later.</P><P>Some software companies make parts of their software invisible if thereis no reason for the user to need access to them. You will notice some invisiblefiles related to ATM (Adobe Type Manager) in one of the screen shots below.</P><P><B>How can I see these invisible files? </B>There is a way to see whichinvisible files you have on your hard drive. The easiest way to take a lookat what is invisible on your hard drive it to use Apple's Find File thatcomes with System 7.5.x.</P><P>If you press Command-F when in the Finder you should get a Find Filewindow. This is Apple's tool for searching your hard drive. If you holdyour mouse button down on the pop-up menu on the left side that containsthe word name you will see other options for searching such as size, kind,file type, etc. But, if you hold down the option key before opening thepop-up you will see a few extra options, the last one being 'Visibility'.Upon selecting 'Visibility' the other settings should change to 'is' and'Invisible' as shown below.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="../../images/ffinv.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="463" HEIGHT="135"></P><P>If you perform this search on your hard drive you will receive resultslike this:</P><P><IMG SRC="../../images/ffinvres.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="505" HEIGHT="308"></P><P>Notice the many invisible files that have been hiding from you all thistime.</P><P><B>Why should I care about invisible files? </B>Most invisible filesyou will never have any reason to care about. There are a few that you maywant to know about. Those are the files related to your Desktop Database.</P><P><B>What is the Desktop Database? </B>Imagine that every time you doubleclicked a document on your hard drive that your Mac had to sort throughevery file it had looking for the program that created it. This could bea lengthy process on a small hard drive let alone the one and two gigabytedrives that are common one new machines. So what Apple devised is a systemof keeping track of what is on your hard drive so that when it needs tosee what is there it can just look it up in the database. The Desktop Databasestores information about all the files on your hard drive and keeps thelinks between your documents and the programs that created them. It is alsowhat handles giving your documents and programs their custom icons.</P><P><B>What else does the Desktop Database contain? </B>In addition to keepingtrack of the things mentioned above, it also holds most of the informationthat can be seen in the get info window (select a file, then select GetInfo from under the File menu). It holds the positioning of each icon inthe Finder windows. It also contains the comments that can be entered inthe 'Get Info' window.</P><P><B>Is the Desktop Database why I keep having those generic icons? </B>Beingthat the Desktop Database is what keeps the information about giving yourfiles and programs those icons that we have gotten used to seeing, whenit is not up to date or has been damaged you can end up with icons likethe ones below.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="../../images/genaricnet.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="119" HEIGHT="44"> <IMG SRC="../../images/genaricdoc.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="42"></P><P><B>Is there a way I can rebuild my desktop? </B>If you are having problemswith icons not showing up properly, or if the program that created a documentisn't opening when you double click the document, you may have an out ofdate or damaged Desktop Database. The first way to rebuild your desktopis to hold down both the Option and the Command keys when you start up yourcomputer. Keep holding them down until you get the message asking you ifyou want to rebuild the desktop on your particular drive and click OK. Youwill notice a progress bar that will have the words 'Rebuilding the Desktop'in it. Once completed your icons should show up properly and the appropriateprograms should launch when their documents are double clicked.</P><P><B>What if the Command-Option method doesn't fix my problem? </B>Thereare a couple of options at this point for what may be going on.</P><P>First of all there may be more serious damage to your Desktop Databaseor your hard drive. At this point I would suggest running Disk First Aidto verify your hard drive to make sure it doesn't have any more seriousproblems going on.</P><P>Secondly you may want to use something like TechTool a free utility from<A HREF="http://micromat.com/mmcs/">MicroMat</A> to actually delete yourDesktop Database and force your Mac to make a new one from scratch. Thisshould get rid of any damage there might be to those files.</P><P><B>Should I rebuild my Desktop Database every so often just to make sureI don't have any problems? </B>In some Mac circles rebuilding the desktopis the suggested solution for every problem under the sun. The above mentionedsymptoms are the most common issues related to the Desktop Database. Ifyou are having problems like crashing or lock-ups, the problem more thanlikely isn't related to the desktop database. Generally there isn't anyreal good reason to rebuild your desktop unless you are experiencing someof the problems mentioned above. I don't see any harm in rebuilding yourdesktop in the conventional way with the command and option every few monthsbut there probably isn't any real advantage either.</P><P><B>I hope I have given you some information about the working of yourMac. It is not my objective to provide every technical detail about eachsubject. What I do want to provide is enough information to help you moreeffectively use your computer on a daily basis.</B></P><P ALIGN="CENTER">If you feel I have helped you understand your Mac better or if the information about invisible files and the Desktop Database has helped you in any way, I'd love to hear about it.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">      <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Bottom navbar.lbi" --><HR SIZE="4"><p align=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><a href="http://www.themacintoshguy.com/">The Macintosh Guy</a> || <a href="../">MacTips</a> || <a href="../../lists/">Email Lists</a> || <a href="http://roguelane.com/blog/">My Blog</a><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p><div align="CENTER"><hr size="4"></div><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></TD>  </TR></TABLE><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;<CENTER><!--GoogleAdsAutomaticSizeSTART--><p align=CENTER><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- Automatic Size --><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-1785703837751368"     data-ad-slot="4468313549"     data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></p><!--GoogleAdsAutomaticSizeEND--></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
