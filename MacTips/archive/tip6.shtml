As we have talked about before, when you areusing RAM there are no moving parts that need to change position. So witha RAM disk you can read and write information without any physical movementtaking place. What this means is that it takes small amounts of electricityto use it and it is extremely fast.</P><P><B>For what would I want to use a RAM Disk? </B>There are a number ofsituations where a RAM Disk would come in handy. If you use a PowerBookand are concerned with saving that precious battery power you might wantto consider a RAM Disk. If you happen to get into a situation where youneed to use your computer without using any of its drives you might wantto consider a RAM Disk. If you have more memory (RAM) than time you maywant to consider running some disk intensive programs from a RAM Disk.</P><P><B>Where do I get a RAM Disk? </B>If you have one of the computers mentionedabove and have 8 megs of RAM or more you already have everything you needto make a RAM Disk. If you look in your Control Panels folder (either underyour Apple Menu or in your System Folder) you will see a Memory controlpanel. If you open it up you will see something like the image below.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="../../images/ramdcntlpnl.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="355" HEIGHT="142"></P><P>All you need to do to use a RAM Disk is to click the On radio button,and adjust the slider to the size you desire. The amount you allocate forthe RAM Disk will be taken out of your available real RAM so be sure toleave yourself enough room to run your System Software. Try starting outwith a RAM disk about 2000K to start with. Once you have it on and the sizeset you only need to restart you computer and you should have a RAM diskavailable to you on your desktop when you start back up. (You may be promptedto initialize the disk after you restart, that is fine, just make sure thesize of the disk you are initializing is close to the size you set yourRAM Disk so you can be sure you are initializing the correct volume.)</P><P><B>Now what do I do with it? </B>One of the most common uses for a RAMDisk is to use it for your web browser's cache. As you surf the interneteverything you see is copied over the internet to a folder which is selectedby your browser. (Usually in your Preferences folder.) When you come toa page on the internet your browser looks to see if it has the page in itscache, if it does it will make sure that the cached item is still up todate and then load it off your hard drive instead of over the internet whichwould take more time. What you can do is to set the cache as the RAM Diskinstead of a folder on your Hard drive. This way instead of needing to loadthe information from your hard drive which has moving parts and is relativelyslow it can get it from the RAM Disk at close to the speed of light!</P><P><B>How can I tell a RAM Disk is really faster than my hard drive? </B>Theeasiest way to the speed of a RAM Disk is to compare it to your hard drive.After creating a RAM Disk find a small program or file on your hard drivethat is a couple hundred K. Select the program or file and select Duplicatefrom the File menu. Now copy the same item onto the RAM Disk and duplicatethe item there. You should notice a significant difference in the time required.</P><P><B>What else can I do with a RAM Disk? </B>The second most common usefor a RAM Disk is to use it as a startup disk. To do this you need to makethe RAM disk at least 4000k, maybe more depending on your particular computer.Generally this is something you will only want to do with 16 megs or moreof real RAM but it is possible on an 8 meg machine. Basically you need tocreate the RAM Disk and then copy the essentials of your system softwareonto it. Usually this would include the System, Finder, and any enableror system update required for your specific machine. If you have enoughRAM you can create a RAM Disk large enough to copy your entire System Folderonto it.</P><P>Once you have your RAM Disk built with all the essential files you simplyneed to select it as the startup disk in your Startup Disk control paneland restart. Not only will you startup significantly faster than normalyou will be running totally independent of your hard drive. This allowsyou to save energy because you don't need to access your hard drive as muchand also allows you to do any maintenance of your hard drive because youraren't using it to run your machine.</P><P><B>What happened to all the information on my RAM Disk? </B>Because yourRAM Disk is in RAM, it will only keep information while your Mac has powerto it. If you shutdown, everything on the RAM Disk is lost, so be sure tokeep backups of anything you use on a RAM Disk.</P><P><B>How do I get rid of my RAM Disk? </B>Because turning off a RAM diskwould erase all the information it contains you aren't allowed to turn itoff if it contains any information. To remove a RAM disk the first thingto do is to trash all the files off the RAM disk and empty the trash. Usuallyyou will be able to enter the Memory control panel and turn it off. If thatdoesn't work the next option is to shut your Mac down and let it sit fora minute then start it back up. You will still have the RAM disk but youshould be able to turn it off at that point.</P><P><B>Are there any utilities that help me use a RAM Disk? </B>Yes, thereare a number of utilities that take advantage of the capabilities of a RAMDisk. Although I have used some I haven't taken the time to try them allout. I would be interested to hear what others use and what their thoughtsare. If I am able to collect enough useful information I'll include it ina future tip.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">If you feel I have helped you understand your Mac any better or if you try using a RAM Disk , I'd love to hear about it.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">      <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Bottom navbar.lbi" --><HR SIZE="4"><p align=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><a href="http://www.themacintoshguy.com/">The Macintosh Guy</a> || <a href="../">MacTips</a> || <a href="../../lists/">Email Lists</a> || <a href="http://roguelane.com/blog/">My Blog</a><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p><div align="CENTER"><hr size="4"></div><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></TD>  </TR></TABLE><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;<CENTER><!--GoogleAdsAutomaticSizeSTART--><p align=CENTER><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- Automatic Size --><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-1785703837751368"     data-ad-slot="4468313549"     data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></p><!--GoogleAdsAutomaticSizeEND--></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
