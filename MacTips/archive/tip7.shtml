This week our discussionleads us to disk images, what they are, and how to use them to your (Macintosh)advantage.</H4><P><B>What is a disk image anyway? </B>Disk images are files that contain&quot;sector by sector&quot; (a sector is just the word for the small sectionsof a disk) copies of a real disks. Disk images differ from just copyingthe information off a disk in that it is an actual copy of the whole disk,not just the parts that have information.</P><P>Have you ever tried to copy the information from one floppy onto anotherand it wouldn't fit? That is because you were just copying the informationinstead of the whole floppy. If Apple just gave us the information for itsupdates and left it to us to put them on floppy disks, we would have a heckof a time trying to get the exact amount of information needed on each disk.What Apple does is distributes disk images so that anybody wanting to makea copy can have one just like the original.</P><P><B>What kinds of things are disk images used for? </B>I've already mentionedthe most common use for disk images in that of a way to distribute updatesfor software. Disk images are also a handy way of making backups of yoursoftware. Many of you have experienced going to reinstall your softwarefrom the original floppies and one of them being unreadable. Unfortunatelyfloppies are not terribly durable and can easily be rendered useless, thereforemaking a disk images of your floppies may be a good option for you. Alsowith disk images you can create an image file from a floppy and send itvia e-mail to a friend and know that he received an exact duplicate of theoriginal. At the core these are the basic uses for disk images but you willsee that they are far more versatile than they first appear.</P><P><B>How do I create disk images? </B>In the past Apple's <A HREF="ftp://ftp.info.apple.com/Apple.Support.Area/Apple.Software.Updates/US/Macintosh/Utilities/Disk_Copy_4.2.sea.hqx">DiskCopy</A> was one of the better options for creating disk images from originalfloppies. It allows you to both create disk images from floppies and floppiesfrom disk images through a simple application. However <A HREF="mailto:chad(at)halcyon.com">ChadMagendanz</A> came up with a better option in <A HREF="http://www.halcyon.com/shrinkwrap/">ShrinkWrap</A>.Instead of opening up an application and clicking on buttons and selectingthe disk you want to create an image on you can simply drag a floppy diskicon onto <A HREF="http://www.halcyon.com/shrinkwrap/">ShrinkWrap</A> andit will create an image for you on the spot.</P><P>Of course all this will make more sense once you <A HREF="ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/users/chad/release/SW-2.1.hqx">downloadShrinkWrap 2.1</A> which has just recently been released.</P><P><B>What does <A HREF="http://www.halcyon.com/shrinkwrap/">ShrinkWrap</A>allow me to do that I can't do with <A HREF="ftp://ftp.info.apple.com/Apple.Support.Area/Apple.Software.Updates/US/Macintosh/Utilities/Disk_Copy_4.2.sea.hqx">DiskCopy</A>? </B>The most significant feature of ShrinkWrap is that it willallow you to access your disk images without actually having to move theinformation to real floppies.</P><P>If you have ever installed the System or one of these major updates fromfloppies you understand the effort it takes to swap all those floppies.If you have ever seen the disk images for 7.5.3 you know that it comes on19 separate floppies. Imagine the time and energy to convert all 19 imagesinto real floppies and then to install them one by one on your computer.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="../../images/unityimgs.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P><P>What ShrinkWrap allows you to do is to drag all those images onto ShrinkWrapand have them mount on the desktop just as if they were floppies in thefloppy drive. (If only you had 19 floppy drives) Once they are mounted youcan install your software and won't have to switch one disk!</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="../../images/mtdimgs.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P><P>I have two Zip disks that I use for disk images, the one you see abovewith all the System Software from Apple and another on which I have imagesof all the software I own.<IMG SRC="../../images/dskimgszip.gif" WIDTH="57" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="TOP" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></P><P>Another feature built into ShrinkWrap is that it works with <A HREF="http://www.aladdinsys.com/">Aladdin System's</A> Stuffit Engine that comeswith their freeware product, DropStuff. With Stuffit Engine not only willShrinkWrap create disk images, it will also compress them after creatingthem. And yes you guessed it, drop a compressed disk image onto shrinkwrapand it will decompress and mount the image on the desktop for your use.</P><P><B>What else do you want to know about ShrinkWrap? </B>This week I wrote<A HREF="mailto:chad(at)halcyon.com">Chad Magendanz</A> a message asking himabout the future of ShrinkWrap and what he thought MacTip readers mightwant to know about it. In response to the future of ShrinkWrap he said:</P><P>&quot;Let me first start out with some news. I'm proud to announce thatAladdin Systems, Inc., developer of the worldwide Macintosh compressionand installation standards, StuffIt and StuffIt InstallerMaker, has justrecently acquired ShrinkWrap. Aladdin will continue to work closely withme and together we will release new versions of ShrinkWrap in early 1997.A press release will follow later this week with more details.&quot;</P><P>Aladdin Systems has a good reputation in the Macintosh community andI am sure they will do wonderful things with the product.</P><P>I also asked about little known cool stuff and Chad responded with afew items. First of all ShrinkWrap will work with any size volume so itis not limited to creating images of floppies. You can create images ofZip disks, SyQuest cartridges, even hard drives. You can also create customsize images by just dragging folders onto ShrinkWrap and it will createan image that is just large enough to hold the information.</P><P>Another thing he mentioned is the ability to create a disk image forstoring many small files in order to more effectively use the space on yourhard drive. (The reasons for this get into some of the more technical workingsof hard drives that we will need to cover in a future tip, I've made <A HREF="chadnote.shtml">Chad's note</A> available if you want to see whathe said.)</P><P><B>What is my favorite thing about ShrinkWrap? </B>Personally, the thingabout ShrinkWrap I appreciate most is the ability to mount disk images inRAM (the micro-chips inside your computer). As we've discussed before thereis a significant performance difference between getting information offyou hard drive as opposed to that residing in RAM. If the preference isselected to mount images in RAM your computer can read and write to thosemounted images incredibly fast. On a multiple disk install having your imagesmounted in RAM means that you can install the software many times fasterthan if they were on floppies or even mounted directly from the disk theoriginal image is on.</P><P>If you haven't used disk images in the past or are unfamilliar with themI suggest you check them out. The read me included with ShrinkWrap coversmuch more than we have discussed hear and may be helpful to you.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">If you feel I have helped you understand your Mac any betteror experiment with disk images, I'd love to hear about it.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">      <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Bottom navbar.lbi" --><HR SIZE="4"><p align=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><a href="http://www.themacintoshguy.com/">The Macintosh Guy</a> || <a href="../">MacTips</a> || <a href="../../lists/">Email Lists</a> || <a href="http://roguelane.com/blog/">My Blog</a><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p><div align="CENTER"><hr size="4"></div><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><div align="CENTER">        <p>&nbsp; </p>      </div>    </TD>  </TR></TABLE><CENTER><!--GoogleAdsAutomaticSizeSTART--><p align=CENTER><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- Automatic Size --><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-1785703837751368"     data-ad-slot="4468313549"     data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></p><!--GoogleAdsAutomaticSizeEND--></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
