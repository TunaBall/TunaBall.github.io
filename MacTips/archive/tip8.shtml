I have only listed onesthat I feel increase my productivity, there are many others that do coolthings but these are the ones I use every time I turn on my system.</H4><P>When it comes to adding utilities to my system I am somewhat of a purist.I think part of it comes from so many years of RAM being so expensive andfrom the need to get work done instead of dealing with extension conflicts.Below I mention a few utilities and a few organization methods that mightbe of help to you. What I am sharing are the basics, there are other thingsI use off and on but these are the things I wouldn't want to live withoutand feel like I'm missing something when they aren't around.</P><P><B>Drop Me? </B>One useful thing that I have been doing for just thepast six months or so is creating a folder on my desktop that I set to 'bySmall Icon' under the View menu and place it on the bottom of my screento the left of the trash with aliases of anything which I require easy dragand drop access. When you drag a file onto an application, that applicationtries to open the file regardless of what the file was created with. Sofor example when I take a snapshot of my screen (command-shift-3) so I canshow you what I'm writing about, if I double clicked that file it wouldopen in SimpleText, but I can drag it onto an alias of Photoshop and thefile opens in Photoshop.</P><P>The key drag and drop utilities are <A HREF="http://www.aladdinsys.com/news/050796.html">DropStuff</A>and <A HREF="http://www.aladdinsys.com/consumer/expander1.html">StuffitExpander </A>from <A HREF="http://www.aladdinsys.com/">Aladdin System's</A>which will compress, encode and decompress almost anything you can findon the net. And of course <A HREF="http://www.halcyon.com/shrinkwrap/">ShrinkWrap.</A>(Check out <A HREF="tip7.shtml">last weeks tip</A> if you want to know aboutit.) I fill up the rest of the space with my most frequently used applicationsand utilities, kind of like a mini Apple Menu.</TD></TR></TABLE><IMG SRC="../../images/dropme.gif" WIDTH="705" HEIGHT="115" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <TABLE WIDTH="677" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0" HEIGHT="1981">  <TR>  <td WIDTH="50" VALIGN="TOP" HEIGHT="225" colspan="2">       <H4 ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</H4>    </td>    <td WIDTH="500" VALIGN="TOP">       <P><B>What about utilities? </B>There are a few utilities that I use that         have become as much a part of my Mac experience as those things that come         straight from <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</A>. These a few different         types but all of them share the fact that they boost my productivity and         don't waste lots of memory.</P>      <P><B>The FREE ones... </B>(well, free or shareware)</P>      <P><IMG SRC="../../images/ctii.gif" WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="LEFT">The         first is my all time favorite utility <A HREF="http://lonestar.texas.net/%7ecardona/ctii/">Click, There It Is!</A>&quot; by Richard         C. Cardona Utilities Group which is available from. What this little wonder does in only 8.5k is similar to         a feature in Now Utilities which lets you click on visible folders when         you are in a save, or open dialog and it will take you there. Have you         ever been in the situation where you have just found a folder in the Finder         but then need to save a file to it from an application? With CTII you         can just click and you are there. I have run this extension on everything         from a Classic to a 8500 and never had a bit of trouble, try it out!</P>      <P><IMG SRC="../../images/drives.gif" WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="135" ALIGN="LEFT"><A HREF="http://www6.zdnet.com/cgi-bin/texis/swlib/mac/infomac.html?fcode=MC10444"><IMG SRC="../../images/pwrpeek.gif" WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0"></A>This         next utility is one that I have only recently found and fell in love with         right away. <A HREF="http://www6.zdnet.com/cgi-bin/texis/swlib/mac/infomac.html?fcode=MC10444">PowerPeek</A>         is available through <A HREF="http://www4.zdnet.com/macuser/">MacUser</A>         and has the sole purpose of keeping an eye out for whether the software         you are running is Power Mac native or not. If that last sentence doesn't         make sense to you then this is not the utility for you. (I'll have to         cover that in a future tip) If it does, <A HREF="http://www6.zdnet.com/cgi-bin/texis/swlib/mac/infomac.html?fcode=MC10444">PowerPeek</A>         will display a little &quot;light&quot; in the upper left hand corner         of your screen that will be green if your Power Mac is running native         and red if it is emulating a 68k machine. Green is good! <A HREF="http://www6.zdnet.com/cgi-bin/texis/swlib/mac/infomac.html?fcode=MC10444">PowerPeek</A>         also keeps track of what you run and can give you a report as to what         might be slowing down your machine. This is more for the power users and         only for Power Mac users, but is certainly worth checking out.</P>      <P><A HREF="ftp://ftp.precursor.mb.ca/pub/MacSense/Shareware/secret-finder-features.hqx"><IMG SRC="../../images/sff.gif" WIDTH="107" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0"></A>This         is <A HREF="ftp://ftp.precursor.mb.ca/pub/MacSense/Shareware/secret-finder-features.hqx">Secret         Finder Features</A>. It doesn't actually do anything except give you access         to some features that are already built into the Apple system software         if you are using 7.5.3 or later. It uses no memory to run. what it gives         you is key commands for commonly used functions. Control-dragging will         make an alias of the original. Command-Delete puts the selected item in         the trash. Command-R will reveal the original item from an alias (just         like the find original button when you get info on an alias.) Supposedly         the only reason for Apple not enabling these features is that they haven't         had time to test them. The only problem I've found is in trying to use         Command-Delete in Users and Groups, my Mac wasn't happy.</P>      <P><A HREF="http://www6.zdnet.com/cgi-bin/texis/swlib/mac/getit.bin?fcode=MC13980"><IMG SRC="../../images/wckylts.gif" WIDTH="63" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0"></A>This         one is mostly useless but I've found it to be handy and it only takes         1k of memory when loaded. What it does is makes your lights on your keyboard         flash back and forth. I've found that this can at times be the only indication         that my computer isn't frozen and that it is just taking it's time to         complete whatever I asked it to do. Try it for what it's worth. <A HREF="http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/Archive/app/ss/wacky-lights-101.hqx">Wacky         Lights</A> is made by <A HREF="http://www.AmbrosiaSW.com/">Ambrosia Software</A>         but I couldn't find a direct link.</P>      <P><A HREF="http://www.grayphics.com/%7efrigid/drivers.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/7200gd.gif" WIDTH="103" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0"></A>These         video drivers are for users of first generation PCI Macs, 7200s, 7500s         and 8500s. It also works on other PCI Macs but check out the page to see         which ones. What this does is accelerates the video on these machines.         I have noticed some difference on my 7200. These are supposedly like the         drivers that will come with System 7.6. If you try them let me know what         you think!

I'm afraid that none         of them are the conflict catching part though. Of course Conflict catcher         allows you to enable and disable control panels, extensions, fonts, and         basically anything in the system folder. You can save sets of all those         and boot with different sets easily. Of the four features of Conflict         Catcher I like the most, three of them have to do with the information         it provides and the fourth is a little menu item.</P>      <P>The information that Conflict Catcher provides that I appreciate are         date installed, memory use, and the name of each extension as they load.         After I install a new piece of software I always want to know what was         installed. With Conflict Catcher you can sort you system items by date         installed so the things on the top of the list are the ones you just installed.         You can also sort by memory use. This can help you to know what items         you can disable that will free up the most memory. The other informational         feature is that as your extensions load across the bottom of your screen         when you startup, Conflict Catcher will not only show you all the ones         that load, it will give you the name of each one.</P>      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="../../images/cc3pnl.gif" WIDTH="505" HEIGHT="441" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P>      <P>The menu item I appreciate most is one titled &quot;Close and Restart&quot;.         Enabling and disabling system items almost always is followed with a restart,         how convenient that they gave us a one step way of doing so.</P>      <P>As far as finding conflicts between extensions? I generally prefer to         turn them on and off by my self to try to find the offending one but there         are certainly people who love Conflict Catcher's conflict finding features.</P>      <P><A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/html/ramdoubler.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/rd2.gif" WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0"></A>In         tip #4 <A HREF="tip4.shtml">Virtual Memory and You</A>, I shared some         concerns with <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/html/ramdoubler.html">Ram         Doubler</A> from <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/">Connectix</A> and         utilities like it. Although I still feel that real RAM is always better         than any sort of virtual memory including <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/html/ramdoubler.html">Ram         Doubler</A>. Ram continues to get cheaper, you can pick up 16 megs for         well less than $100. Check out <A HREF="http://www.macresource.pair.com/mrp/ramwatch.shtml">RamWatch</A>         for weekly prices or <A HREF="http://www.thechipmerchant.com/">The Chip         Merchant</A> is usually competitive and publishes their prices on the         web. The feature that <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/html/ramdoubler.html">Ram         Doubler2</A> has that has convinced me to use it is the ability to only         enable file mapping. (Check out Tip #4 <A HREF="tip4.shtml">Virtual Memory         and You</A> for an explanation of file mapping.) This allows me on my         32 meg 7200 to run PageMill, Photoshop, and Internet Explorer 3.0 (Sorry,         I don' generally like running Microsoft products but Netscape 3.0 is just         too big!) at the same time. I appreciate the fact that with <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/html/ramdoubler.html">Ram         Doubler2</A> I can have some of the benefits of virtual memory but don't         loose any performance or disk space.</P>      <P><IMG SRC="../../images/spdacc.gif" WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="LEFT">Speed         Access is a part of <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/html/speeddoubler.html">Speed         Doubler</A> from <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/">Connectix</A>. Speed         access is a smarter Disk Cache than Apple's but it still functions in         the same way. In Tip#3, <A HREF="tip3.shtml">Your Disk Cache</A>, I talk         about what a disk cache is and how it works. Everything mentioned in that         tip is all true still with Speed Doubler's Speed Access.</P>      <P><IMG SRC="../../images/spdem.gif" WIDTH="73" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="LEFT">Speed         Emulator is also a part of <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/html/speeddoubler.html">Speed         Doubler</A> from <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/">Connectix</A>. Speed         Emulator is a better and faster 68k emulator for Power Macs. If you run         only Power Mac native applications Speed Emulator will only help you a         little by speeding up some functions of the finder but with older, non-native         applications you may notice significant speed improvements with it.</P>      <P>You may have noticed that I have not included Speed Copy with Speed Access         and Speed Emulator. At this point the ability to copy faster, and to copy         multiple items at once while still having access to the Finder is not         worth the risk of using Speed Copy to move my data. <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/">Connectix</A>         is one of the best companies for getting updates to its customers. I         bet they have sent out more free disks than most software companies (excluding         AOL of course). However there is always a problem that those updates fix.         For instance one of my clients was having problems with every time he         copied some files they would get corrupted, he had an old version of Speed         Copy that was the cause. <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/">Connectix</A>         was great about getting us the update and it was free but there was still         the time of figuring out what the problem was. For me the possible problems         out weigh the benefits.</P>      <P ALIGN="CENTER">If you try any of the techniques or utilities mentioned,         if you have any thoughts about this weeks tip, or if there is a utility         that you think I wouldn't be able to live without, I'd love to hear about         it.
