With the old find file it meant trudging through all           the files that met your find criteria item by item and pressing 'command-G'           to get to the next one.</P>        <P>Needless to say Apple has improved things greatly with the modern Find           File which is now actually a small application that launches when you           press 'command-F' or select it from the 'Apple Menu'. The current version           of Find File is 1.1.2. If you are running 7.5.3 (System 7.5 Update 2.0)           or later you have the current version.</P>        <P><B>Why I love Apple's Find File. </B>The three greatest things that           Apple's Find File has going for it are that it is small, fast, and useful.           There are other utilities that perform similar functions but I haven't           found one that is as graceful and as helpful for every day use.</P>        <P><B>What's new with find file? </B>The most significant change for Find           File was in becoming PowerMac native. This means one thing, speed. I           don't have any hard numbers handy but I remember comparing two machines           side by side one with 7.5.1's Find File and the other with 7.5.3's.           The improvement was significant. Other than that, Find file hasn't changed           much since the original release of System 7.5 and I don't believe there           are any significant changes in the works for the near future either.           (I think the engineers at Apple have more important things to spend           their time on.)</P>        <P><B>What about drag and dropability?</B> The thing that I usually appreciate           the most in applications is their ability to drag and drop. With Find           File you can actually both drag in and out.</P>        <P><IMG SRC="../../images/eudorab9icn.gif" WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Eudora Installer Icon"><B>Dragging in. </B>Dragging into           the Find File window fills in the find criteria with the information           of the item you dragged into it. For example I dragged the installer           for the latest beta of <A HREF="http://www.eudora.com/">Eudora</A> Light           into the Find File window with all the find criteria options open and           all the information was filled in for me as you can see below.</P>        <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="../../images/ffwindow.gif" WIDTH="463" HEIGHT="414" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Find File window"></P>        <P>This feature is especially useful when you want to find all the files           similar to a file you have. For instance, if you are looking for all           the files on your hard drive that were created with QuarkXPress, you           simply set the find criteria to 'creator' and drag a QuarkXPress file           onto the find window and click 'Find'. The results window will pop up           with all the files that were created with QuarkXPress.</P>        <P><B>Dragging out. </B>Dragging out from the 'Items Found' window works           just like the Finder. You can select one or multiple items and just           drag them to where you want them to be. If the original items are located           on the same volume (i.e. hard drive, network volume, floppy, zip disk,           etc.) as the one you are dragging to, the items will be moved, and if           they are on a different volume the items will be copied. You can hold           down the option key before you drag and they will be copied regardless           of where they are being dragged from, just like the Finder.</P>        <P><IMG SRC="../../images/ffdelwarng.gif" WIDTH="340" HEIGHT="147" ALIGN="RIGHT"><B>Find File updates itself. </B>One thing I use Find File           for is to delete unwanted copies of software. Whether it is getting           rid of the extra copies of Simple Text that seem to multiply by themselves           or different versions of some software I am testing, I can simply search           for the name of the application and drag from the 'Items Found' window           into the trash. If I empty the trash and then click on one of the items           that was deleted, I get this message, and Find File grays out the items           that have been deleted. Find File also updates when files have been           moved.</P>        <P><B>What's in the Menus?</B> Many people have never taken the time to           take a look at the Find File menu items. Although the menus have the           same titles as some of the Finder's menus, there are a few little gems           in there for those who are willing to take the time to look. My favorite           one is 'Open Enclosing Folder' or command-E. This will open the folder           which contains the selected item or items. This allows you to select           a number of items and then take a look at them. You can also change           the 'Sharing...' options for items, and change the 'lables' for items           found.</P>        <P><B>Secret Search Criteria?</B> Yes, there are four search criteria           that will allow you to search for things that are not normally on the           list. If you hold down the option key before you pop up the search field           on the left hand side of the Find File window (the one that is set to           'name' by default), you will see a dividing line where the list usually           stops and four items below it, 'contents', 'name/icon lock', 'custom           icon', and 'visibility'. You can use these to search for files that           contain certain text, have locked names or icons, items with custom           icons, or invisible items. Probably the most useful of the four is going           to be 'contents'. I don't know how many times I have been searching           for a file that the only thing I can remember about it is one of the           sentences it contains. This feature allows you to search for text actually           in the documents so you can find your file even if you can't remember           anything about the file itself.</P>        <P><B>Useless but true? </B>I found that if you have your hard drive as           the search location and hold down the option key as you click on the           pop-up it won't &quot;pop up&quot;. What you can do is drag it to your           desktop and create an 'untitled clipping' that contains nothing. I'm           thinking this is either an oversight on Apple's part or something really           cool that I haven't figured out yet. If you have any ideas let me know!           Just curious...</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><h4 align="CENTER"><hr></h4><p align=CENTER><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Archive NavBar.lbi" --><a href="http://www.themacintoshguy.com/">The Macintosh Guy</a> || <a href="../">MacTips</a> || <a href="../../lists/">Email Lists</a> || <a href="http://roguelane.com/blog/">My Blog</a><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></p><h4 align="CENTER">         <hr>      </h4><p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>      </TD>    </TR>  </TABLE><CENTER><!--GoogleAdsAutomaticSizeSTART--><p align=CENTER><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- Automatic Size --><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-1785703837751368"     data-ad-slot="4468313549"     data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></p><!--GoogleAdsAutomaticSizeEND--></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
