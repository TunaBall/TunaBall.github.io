Subscribers will receive a copy of every message sent to the posting address for the list. If you wish to respond, post, or otherwise have your words sent to everyone on the list, send email, either by replying the message to which you are responding or sending a new email to the list address.</p><p>The list management program is set up so selecting &quot;Reply&quot; in your emailer will send a message to the entire list. If you wish to respond individually to the sender of the message, be sure to address your message accordingly. There should be no need to copy messages to both the author and the list.</p><p><b>What is Netiquette?</b></p><p>There are informal rules of the internet which are termed &quot;Netiquette.&quot; to help people use proper etiquette within this form of communication. Some examples of poor Netiquette. are not to signing messages, unsubscribing by sending mail to the posting address instead of the administrative address, or TYPING IN ALL CAPS, (which is considered yelling). This is a dynamic environment and Netiquette. is changing rapidly.</p><p>Some informal rules for this list</p><ul><li>Remember that replies automatically go to the entire list. To respond to an individual, see the directions for your email software.<li>Never send attachments to the list. An attachment may contain a virus, may be in a format others cannot use, may not make it through some mail gateways, and will bog down both the list server and the mail server. (Large enough attachments will choke the list server.)<li>Don't send styled text or HTML files, just plain text. (My rule of thumb: if it's not in the body of the text, I won't read it.)<li>Please quote only the relevant portion of messages you respond to -- and please quote some of the original message so others know what you're responding to.<li>Please keep &quot;me too&quot; and &quot;agreed&quot; messages off the list; these are best sent privately.<li>When asking a question, please list relevant information on the hardware, software, and version of the Mac OS involved.<li>When responding to a digest post, please change the subject to match that of the original message.<li>Please keep signature lines concise, preferably 6 lines or less<li>Although subscribers may offer specific equipment and services to the list or share an exceptional bargain they have discovered, explicitly commercial postings are prohibited. Any address or domain posting such will be blocked.<li>Treat your list neighbor as you wish to be treated. Address breaches of Netiquette. privately, not on the list. Assume the best, not the worst.</ul><p><b>What tone is expected in the discussion and who will facilitate this?</b></p><p>I hope this will become a kind and helpful community. Since Mac users range from beginners to gurus, please be tolerant of &quot;dumb&quot; questions.</p><p><b>Do you have any policies about selling products or services on the list?</b></p><p>I've learned that most experts on any list gain their expertise professionally. For those who make a living selling equipment or services, we have the following guidelines.</p><ul><li>List members may mention the availability of commercial services or products on the list, but no prices. (Individuals may list personal equipment with prices.)<li>All correspondence regarding services or products should be conducted privately, not on the list.<li>Neither the publisher nor the list mom makes any claim regarding services or products offered by members of the list.</ul><div align="right"><p><font size="2">This FAQ adapted from <a href="http://lowendmac.com/lists/">Dan Knight's email lists</a>.</font></p></div><div align="center"><p><a href="../lists/">Lists</a> || <a href="../mactips/">MacTips</a> || <a href="../about.shtml">About TMG</a> || <a href="../contact.shtml">Contact</a> </p><p><br><!--GoogleAdsAutomaticSizeSTART--><p align=CENTER><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- Automatic Size --><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-1785703837751368"     data-ad-slot="4468313549"     data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></p><!--GoogleAdsAutomaticSizeEND--></p></div></body></html>
